"Upgraded my phone to Galaxy s21
"So I just bought the pro version
Moved to pro
"TweetCasterPro WAS great app
"I used the free version for a year or so and found it worked well
Excellent
Paid upgrade does not allow me to import any of the years of config and customisation done in the free version. I feel penalised for buying it.
Garbage app. 👎
When is the last update for this? It lags wonth let me delete lists full of bugs!
"Don't you guys think it's been a very very long time to update and implement the actual twitter features like quote gif
"Waiting for class action lawsuit haha used to be so good
Fix the widget already. Doesn't work on note 20 ultra and latest Android OS
"Stop the timing out. No other app stops people from Tweeting
"So many basic operations
Not able to create widget at Android 11.pls help.
Nice app for info on most anything
Would be five stars please make some bigger Widgets plzzzzzzzz
Much improved. Still can't figure our how to change an AVI or background photo. I am NOT the smartest IT guy around.
amazing Twitter app
Solid app.
Having issues removing accounts
Hreat control over multiple accounts.
"This app has not been updated since my previous review in 1/2020. Functionality is failing
Miss the FB linking and font changing but it's better than the Twitter app imho! 🐦
Why is this so slow? Any updates in the near future?
great app but trends don't work properly from time to time and trends are the most important part of twitter
After years of owning TweetCaster Pro I still love it!
"Yes you do deserve this review & the 1 star rating. Update: Dec 05/17 - they figured out that Twitter allows 280 characters
"This used to be the gold standard of twitter clients but since September 2020
"Update: This app is lagging and has had zero updates since January when their token was restored..... Very glad to have Tweetcaster back after the access token issue! No other 3rd party Twitter app's functionality compares. Hopefully the devs stick around for further updates
"Trending is back
Trends are not correct...not showing new trends from last 3 days...it showing same trends 😔
"*updated rating* As of 08/25/2020 App is not refreshing
"Avoid
"The best Twitter app available
It can't download video. Also webpage error when clicking links.
"I love that app
Over the past few months this app has become very slow to load new tweets. Clicking links has even longer load times. No updates since January.
"One of the best app i use for twitter
"Is good but I need editing my control panel for my notifications and messages
Great app
After coming back to Android after a few years this app needs updating and it would be nice to see some buttons under each tweet to favorite or reply even read replies. Also is doesn't notify me of new tweets anymore.
Easy way to use twitter
"I Can't see my DM anymore
Great app but terrible UI needs a cleaner interface
I love tweetcaster!!
Love it!!
I like it 👌
Great app if I didn't get a 403 error each time I try to add users to a list. Also nearby should have a option nearby on followers friends list/yours. I'll update my review when we get a update
"It supposed to be good twitter app. But recently I find this app ""tweetcaster has stop working"" or ""force close"""
"Widget no longer works on Note 9? Any advice please. Uninstalled / installed no change. Widget is dragged to home page
Still my favourite Twitter app
"Had this app forever and rarely have issues. Lately though
TweetCaster Pro was my go2 Twitter app for YEARS until Nov 2019 when crash after crash led me 2 uninstall it & start having 2 use a different app. Just recently found that there was a long-overdue update in Jan 2019 & was very excited 2 start using TweetCaster Pro again! Had 2 adjust app permissions 4 TweetCaster Pro timeline widget when it wouldn't work but app permission adjust fixed that. Now having issue w/TweetCaster Pro Aviary Plugin crashing. WILL stick w/TweetCaster & hope 4 some fixes!
Works for me
"يا أخ عبدالله السبيعي خاصية إخفاء الرتويت تجدها أضيفت مع التصفية الذكية ""smart filter"""
Has Pro's & Cons but nothing that I can't tolerate. Best of the Twitter apps for me.
"knocked off 2 stars
"24Apr2020 Hi
Best one for my uses. There are few issues but nothing big. I like it and One Louder Apps was quick to respond to a request. Solid Twitter app.
I can't see who favourite the tweets.
Fast response for thread support. Still I have failure for some kind of link. Back to 4 stars. Although not seriously updated for over a year still a very good app. Though they need to maintain it... I can't open some kind of links from the app and they don't respond through their Twitter.
It is the best of its kind. Love the fact that when there is a reply to a tweet it gives you the whole conversation.
"Thank u for updating this app again. I'd like to see shortcut for ""RT or reply or like"" directly under people's posts instead of clicking the post to RT/reply/like the posts. I hope we can have it in the next update 😁 been using this app since 2011 and this is the best for me."
I bought the app and it is awesome. Please add full support for Fediverse protocols as well.
Good view of tweets and RTs are better because give good description not just web address! Would like if all dis9layed in landscape but majority do so 4 stars!
So many things go wrong while using this app.. The widget for starters doesn't stay on my screen
Best twitter app! I wouldnt go any where else. Check it out !!
"I am happy to be back again after 
Purchased this just because of widget which crashes every time I'm trying to add it onto desktop.
"Downloaded app for the widget availability because my other one has been screwy for months...now
we need a update! this is a great app
"I really tweetcaster. I've tried several other apps including the official Twitter app but this is the best. I can control background & text color
i rather not have pic vid on feed but wont load pic or vid on link unless ya turn on the media... even when menu comes up saying open link it wont... be nice to have look at convo without having to go via menu... other than that it has best layout than most twit apps
"Could not connect to Twitter
Oke setelah sekian lama tidak di update. Saya coba ini aplikasi. Kalau masih ada yang error saya hapus !
"Works
Most enjoyable. More versatile than Twitter's app.
Seems like this app is not incompatible. I am unable to post tweets and no updates to this app since 2018. Update: issue resolved
Best App for tweeter
"Mostly dead app with regards to innovation. This company or individuals that write the software
"Author updated API token but still needs to be modernized with VIDEO SUPPORT U/D directly with Twitter not outdated YouTube. Twitter supports video directly now. Its a good Twitter app but with more work could be great. FAVESTAR is Dead & support needs to be removed. Better single page followers to match who & who doesnt needed. Eveything works as far as I can tell but still testing. Thanks for the update. Ron@Memphis
i cant access my account

Update fkd it up. Can't get in. FIX it... UPDATE!! OneLouder has responded - quickly - and are working with Twitter to resolve the issues. Great customer service... Thx!
Very expensive and no updates since ages.
Better than the official twitter app!!
Kudos to OneLouder for continuing to support this app. I paid a couple of pounds for it almost a decade ago and am delighted to see it still being supported.
Finally tweetcaster is working again. The best Twitter app is back !!!
The best. The most simple easy to use l.
I have used Tweetcaster Pro for years and have been very happy with it. Happy that they fixed the recent issue but now I can't get the widget to work.

Thank you for the update. It's fixed now. And here's your 5 stars reinstated.
Working now after the update! Missed using it while it was down. Didn't like using Twitter's app while waiting for the fix.
"Byy far and away the best app for Twitter. Best user interface. I wish they would display the ""likes"" like the regular app does; this one just goes to the ""Favestar is for sale"" message"

"Second update: so Onelouder does not monitor their auth token and only reacts to 1 star reviews. Says it all: this app is dead and being neglected. Update january 2019: apparently this app is dead. I recommend Tweetings as a replacement. Rating down to one star
"Yay
needs an update. won't open.

Tweetcaster is working again 👍👍 Best Twitter client ever.
App is working again after the update Best one I've used for Twitter. Glad it has been fixed
Huge THANK YOU to the devs for coming back after a year and a half to update the API token so we can still use this app. It's been my favorite for nearly a decade and the thought of switching to the official app was so upsetting. I missed my temporary zip list so much!
Thank you for getting that token fixed. All is well once again and my favorite 3rd party Twitter app has been restored!
App is fixed! Best Twitter app. Period! Thank you One Louder!
"Always been great
Thank god for the update
yuhuuuu..it's working again!!..thanks for updated
Stopped working. Can not connect to Twitter anymore. No information. Their web site/blog hasn't been updated for years. Last tweet from them over a year ago. Is the company still alive?
"cant get this to work
Dont buy or use this app! The owner is to lazy to contact Twitter to update their Token. Freaking waste of money here. Even Google wont refund funds paid for this worthless app.
These few days I cannot sign in because its say cannot connect with twitter.. Hope it's can be solve asap..
First time purchase on a Brand New Phone One Week Ago...tons of bugs and now it won't even let me sign in...From the bottom of my heart I'm warning you all! YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED

Can't connect to Twitter. It's dead. This is the end. Or maybe the developers don't have enough money to pay the APIs anymore.

Where are you developers? The app has stopped signing in for all users. Update as soon as possible.
Been using it for years now ot does not let me access
It appears this app had been abandoned. Last night it broke for everyone i know of who was using it. Still down and no response from the developers. Thankfully there are alternative app not put out by this company.

I've noticed that my lists don't populate anymore on my Galaxy Tab. They do populate on my phone (Pixel2) however. Is this a known issue?

Great app.
The App will not delete old direct messages. Also cannot upload pics
Easy to navigate.
"C""mon Man ! It's been exactly a year since any update on this app. Should I consider it Abandonware or what ? Still a okay app but no improvements ...such as that bright compose window that can double as a phone flash light. Darken things alittle bit. Need a new way to customize things as well."
It's high time this app gets more update
Best Twitter app I've tried. Actually shows tweets in chronological order!!!!
In desperate need of an overhaul... Don't buy this in its present state...
Widget keeps closing the app when I try to add it to my home screen.
hasn't worked in 3 months. the app can't connect to twitter to even sign in.
I have 3 android devices and it is important to me that I can sync the timeline. Unfortunately it just doesn't work.
"I have adjusted/edited my 1 star 🌟 review to a 5 🌟
A reasonable twitter platform. Some minor odd behavior and slightly opaque design in places but otherwise fine.
Doesnt show images in tweets posted through Twitter Ad composer.
"I had a problem with an older version of the paid app. It kept showing ads. When I reported the problem they refunded me quickly which showed me a responsive customer service. That problem is fixed now. It's a great way to use Twitter on android. One precaution I'd give is
when I click on the favourites button of any tweet the app takes me to an external useless webpage ... can you fix this problem?? I want to see the favourites of any tweet within the app. I am very annoyed.
Good.
"Well I have been using this app for a while. I use to really live it
Notifications have stopped working since I changed from Sansung Galaxy s6 to s10. Has been my go to app otherwise.
Since a long time there are no updates to the program
I bought this app and it doesn't even work won't even connect to Twitter what's up with that?
I want to cancel my twitter app. Just had it for 10min... Need refund!
Their latest update is dumb as all hell. Can't use the app to edit uploaded picks. When you click on a picture you can rotate. save it. but there's no damn back button. You have to click on the picture to back up 🤷‍♂️
The ability to send direct messages to followed accounts has stopped. Don't pay for this app until it is repaired. It was a twitter dot com problem
wonderful tool.
So far pretty good...
Am one of this app fans but I have some comments on it. 1. It gets freezing when I am playing videos and can't solve it unless I restart my phone 2. It is slow app when it concerns with photos view 3. Updates are always late
I've been using this app since 2010 and it hasn't failed me yet!
l am still discovering it's features over all great
Receiving no new tweet notifications at all. Don't know what's going on with this app.
"Used to love this app. Like REALLY love it. But looks like it's no longer supported. Had to change password on a couple of my accounts via the Twitter web page - and now am unable to access those accounts on the app. Can't even delete the old accounts and re-add them with the new passwords.

Used to love this but Lists still not working on Samsung Galaxy Tab S4. No sign of a fix and last updated 29th October 2018. Developer doesn't even reply. Time to go back to Owly I think. Downgraded to 2 stars as still no interest shown by developer and still no update since Oct 2018. Got to make it 1 star now and that's too many.
Works plain and simple
widgets will not load on latest android system please fix widgets
Excellent

"Why does every want to mention
notifications not working have to open app to see if new tweets
Should have paid long ago. developers are worth investing in and these folks I certainly trying to provide us a good platform. this is the best app I have found.
it use to be an awsome app no updates since october 2018 it doesn't refresh línea it use to about uninstall it's a shame i buyed the pro way back
"App keeps crashing
"was nice
Most videos are no longer playing in the app. I am using Samsung Tab4. SM-T531 Android version 5.0.2.
Excellent for filtering Twitter and presenting information in a readable way; but would it be too much trouble not to rely on long-defunct favstar for who has liked tweets?
Amazing
"I've tried a lot of twitter clients
I've been a TweetCaster Pro user for years and I've always considered it 5 stars.
Great app so far. Been using twitter for a few days & didn't like the generic twitter. TweetCaster was a worthy purchase! Great job Devs!

Still needs more bug fixes. Can't edit or remove old Twitter accounts in settings. Time lag to access user information gets longer over time.
"Well
Love this app but the trending topics have stopped working. Haven't updated since Christmas.
I'm giving 5 because Twitter is attacking 3rd party apps by forcing them to remove features to migrate more users to their native app. The widget or notifications is never coming back yall... the trends seem broke too. One louder yall have been magnificent supporting this app but Twitter has declared war to control revenue. Im in it to the end with yall. 1louder is the reason I actually still use Twitter even tho the official app has gotten better. Its been a pleasure!!!!
Usually great.
Bit glitchy on times but worth it to get rid of all the Twitter changes that Jack keeps introducing and to be able to turn off retweets for your whole timeline
Not bad. Used to be great but now rather dated. Needs an overhaul. Could easily be made top of the range.
Does not display notifications anymore. I have to open the app to check only to find 150+ new tweets. Needs to be fixed since I paid for pro.
I do not get notifications any longer. It's worthless for me without notifications. Yes I have them set up to work.
"Was always a won app
The only things I find wrong. The tweet notification is screwed only show when it wants too also if you install a custom notification setting for a account there is no way to delete them. Also the faqs fonts suck bad can't see it in the white background of the website and no way to leave a reply as I can see no support page
"This has been my go to Twitter app for many years. Last update killed the widget essentially making the app useless. The whole point is to have my feed up on my desktop where I get an occasional glance
I originally bought it on the Amazon store. When it stopped updating there I decided to I it again on the Google store.
Will not allow a connection to Facebook. In app buttons for Facebook are missing.
"Best Twitter app
The Widget still broken cannot added to the homescreen (Honor 8X)
"What? You say you've fixed DM? There's still no access to DM's that are in a group
Like the app and use it for years however the widget function is now broken and I can no longer add it to my home screen
"Pros: Shows more than 20 trending topics. Cons: no group chat
"Update 2: Some features functioning again. Widget still broken
"Have lost my lists
"Over the last 2 years I've tested/assessed this app OFTEN. I'm updating my review again. STILL excellent.. It seems to get better and better
"Swift follow up. Still a bit glitchy when trying to tweet with pic. It goes immediately to ""failed tweet""."
This app worked flawlessly until this update. It doesn't notify me of any tweets anymore. I have to open the app to check for any tweets now.
"It is a great app
Pictures are back but notifications aren't. I'm sure they're working on it though with how fast they fixed the picture problem.
Notifications for new tweets is no longer working since last update. Pictures seem to have been resolved but having to open the app & refresh it every time is a bit frustrating. Please fix!
Updated
"It had been a good app before
"My original review was full of praise for this app & 5 stars. As of today (19.09.18)
Since the update a few days ago i no longer get new tweet notifications
The one killer thing this has over official app is better list management. Would be nice to see a material design rework.
the most thing i really love in this app is (zip) but i hope soon as possible you can add more features downlod video for example as many apps did
Revising rating from two stars to five now that the DM issue is fixed!  ------  Used to love this app but now I can't read my DMs. Apparently the solution is to download Tweetcaster and pay AGAIN for Pro? Way to piss off your previous customers! Please update this app or give us free upgrades. Thanks.
"Excellent app
Now that it is fixed. Best app for Twitter!
After a fix back to being the best again.
Thank you for fixing the images so quickly.
EDIT: Update fixed the photos issue and it opened quickly. OLD: Fixed DMs but broke everything else including profile pics and non Instagram pictures. Uninstalled and reinstalled but now it's not even opening!
"And boom
A recent update made the App largely unusable due to inability to view photos. Developers responded extremely quick and fixed the issue. Top marks returned and justifiably so. Best twitter client that I've found and only missing twitter polls to make it perfect.
The latest update has removed everyone's avatars and any picture or video screenshot. I've stopped using it til it's fixed
What the hell happened? No icons?
Will there be a fix for the missing feature of posting tweets to Facebook? It is the major reason why I am using this app instead of the official Twitter app. 😒

"I am legally blind and this app is perfect for me. I can blow up the font and read without my magnifier. So easy to scroll and create lists. Customer service is old-fashioned and REAL. The explanations are precise
"Was a great app
"Hope you don't like pictures or user icons
"It's still a good app
UI has to change..
The best tweet app I have ever used
"I think the Dev. Stop this app long time no update
Non pro version updated to fix DM issue. Why hasn't the pro version been fixed or even updated since December 2017?
No longer able to access DMs from within the app. I will amend my review if and when this is fixed.
Loyal user of Pro for 7+ years. Unfortunate to see it so broken. Loss of DMs totally destroyed it's usefulness to me. Sad.
Reply All doesn't reply to all. Only to the original tweet. Especially on RTs. This is super dumb. Especially since I paid for this app. Figured out after they don't even update this app anymore. Avoid.
"Below average. App can't view threads unless people link to last post of thread (most people link first). Has issues with IG photos. Polls not visible (twitter's fault
Direct messaging no longer works!
"Seems like the devs have truly given up on this app
The best Twitter app for non business persons. Themes and other features are all awesome.
"Not the best anymore: (Size?) Smart filter y? image/sort? FS image view
Works good. Especially the tablet version. One thing that is annoying is that you constantly have to load tweets in between.
still no gif support. PLEASE put interactions in the same tab as mentions. trying to make people who already paid for the app years ago pay again should be criminal but it's still a good app and i can still figure out how to get it biiiihh

Outstanding app . Only problem is that username of mention count as character of tweet
Best!
I want a refund. I can't use the app. Twitter blocks it's use. Help!
Uninstalled because of link integration failures from Twitter email notifications.
"Love using this app
"""Make It My Own"" or ”Add to existing list"" doesn't work for large lists. If there is a user you cant add in the middle of the list it stops everything
DM no longer works. Very annoying!
"Fantastic
Tried a few other apps over the last couple of hours. I have returned to TweetCaster as nothing else comes near
"Finally 280ch. But now ""more details"" is destroying my battery life. Why must I wait for RTs & Replies to load (often 1-2 min.) before I can get at the permalink? Put ""Copy Permalink"" in the top menu for 5 stars!"
"My only and default Twitter app.  Has been for years.  Packed full of features and worth every penny.  Not one gripe.  Find better
"I hate one thing the most: the ""shared using TweetCaster"" it adds to shared tweets; should be editable in the paid version. Switched to another app."
It works but has some issues needs an update could be layed out and explained a lot more not sure how effective it is at avoiding bot detection and no auto followback feature
Great app
Does everything that I want except for one thing. Needs notifications when someone favors or retweets one of your posts. Also doesn't support the auto play for videos. Sometimes can't tell if there is a video or not.Other that. This is the best Twitter app out.
"Outdated user interface 
البرنامج ممتاز
For using it to reply on the timeline it's great.   But look at a tweets replies or a user's tweets and there is a serious problem where it stops responding for minutes at a time while it builds the tweet list. Often long enough for the phone to ask if I want to report or stop the app! Reported it dozens of time and nothing's been done.
Does exactly what I want it to do
I'd like to see the feature to hide retweets made a feature that can be turned off permanently. I don't like having to turn off retweets every time I launch the app.
I've tried the other apps - some for years. TweetCaster is the best and most reliable.
Great
"Is it possible to put either a play button or a pic icon on the pictures? Many times I have clicked
Great app for tweeting on the go.
Best & comfy twitter apps for me..
It has been choppy when scrolling. Has been happening for over a year.
"Utter trash
Best Twitter client on the market.
Best Twitter app so far....
TweetCaster has been my default twitter app for years.  Recent update addressed the 280-character issue.
Great App!
"I understand 280 characters is in beta. Your betas last longer than Verizon's.  Updated 7Dec17
"Brilliant app. Upgraded from free version a couple of years back..  Improvements could include ability to retweet from multiple accounts
"It's a shame the developer has abandoned this app. It was so useful and had great functionality. But it's not been updated in over a year
got the much needed update for the 280 characters and now just gotta check if it works with notifications.. thanks for the update
Best app for Twitter.  But couple enhancements could be placed.  1. Choose account under which I'd like to retweet.  2. uploading images is awful. Uploaded pictures has a such poor quality.
Best Twitter app. Ever. (Thanks for updating!)
Simply the best Twitter app available on the market.
Please update and stop forcing push notifications for stuff i specifically set to not notify me on. 140 char limit still? OLD
I would gladly beta test the 280 character limit feature.  Responding to developers. Please sign me up for beta.
Has not updated for several months after 280 characters. Still forces you to mention who you're replying to.
Would like to become a beta tester
"In 2010
Like how you can view by most recent.
Are you going to update this soon or are you abandoning?
Is there any new version to allow 280 letters?
Waiting for the update so I can use 280 characters.
Any plans to increase the character limit to 240 anytime soon?
Are you ever going to update this app?
I would rate 5 if i can upload video without using Youtube
Excellent app
"No update? For a paid version
"Has not updated since 2016
A lot going on for Twitter geeks. I like it cause it's easy enough to get to grips with. Needs updating to use the new character limit though. I'd give it 5* if it had that feature.
"Look and feel still great
"Great
"They gave up. Last update was a year ago. Promises were made 6 months ago. Still
I've used this app for years and love it. When will it be updated to support 280 characters?
It looks like Tweetcaster has not been updated in some time and it doesn't support the new 280 character limit or the fact that referencing people shouldn't count towards the 140 character limit.
"STILL WAITING for the change introduced by Twitter to allow usernames
Disappointed that they have yet to come out with an update for the 280 character change and Twitter videos are no longer working. Will have to find another go-to app until this gets resolved.
Please update to the 280 character limit.
App has not been updated to fit Twitters increase to 280 characters.
Good customisable Twitter app that allows me to avoid the promoted tweets. There are some issues however. It doesn't seem to know at all if someone has favourited one of your tweets and doesn't support some of the newer features such as the higher character count or polls.
"The best Twitter app I have used. I have used the free version for over a year
the best one for tweeting.
Great job. Thanks
I've switched phones three times in five years and this is one of the apps I promptly install on the new one.
"The TL looks fabulous
Works well. Much improved!
Love it!
The only one Twitter app that i love most
Good app
I love tweetcaster but it slow and it freezes a lot. Please fix it. I'm using nexus 5x with android 8.0
"Awesome app
Much more organized and better than the default twitter app. Worth the five bucks for sure.
"Iove the free app
The best twitter app there is hands down. Keep up the good work. Just can't work out why it doesnt open tweets from the bottom as it is set to do. Also crashes when opening camera for a picture
Best twitter client!
Awesome
"DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS. It is getting no development
"I miss when this app was updated regularly and was useful. It gets updated once a year
Pls have an update soon twitter is now 280 characters and can dm people you are not following but yup like this app a lot and there is still room for improvement!
hasn't been updated in a long time.
"Its okay. I like it for browsing
Was (A full social media management app)... no updates for nearly a year now turned it useless.
"Readability is gone
Love it!
"Used to work great.  Now
It's the Openings Businesses Dream Stream App!!
Still loving it after years of usage (　^ω^)
This app should be the default app for Twitter and it shouldn't be one you have to pay for because it does nothing special
"What was once a great app is now slow
This app is terrible there is a big blue line blocking my timeline now I cant see my tweets anymore please fix this problem asap.
Love the tweet longer😘
Great
sad paid for App.. but no more update.. nothing changes.. Learn from Talon and Flamingo App plz
Is best twitter app out there love it on my g3
"No matter what I try
"Crashes way to much! Love all the other features just need to fix the crashes
"There's a current annoying bug where it endlessly pings you with the same notification.  I have all but ""mentions"" turned off.  If I get a single mention
Excelente aplicación!
While there was a lot to like about this Twitter app (the reasons why I bought it) the haven't been any updates for over eight months and so the new Twitter features since then aren't supported.
"It's okay. The thing I don't like is that it doesn't tell you if someone starts following you
Much better than the native Twitter app.
Twitter has become a joke..do.not wish to be associated with it anymore..Bubbye..
"I get 'refresh rate limit' messages all the time
It constantly flickers. So annoying. Will look for another app.
It's good. Needs a update so videos play automatically like on the original Twitter app. Don't like how ya have to click the vids to play them. But overall it's good.
"Getting worse and worse
Have used this for years.  Zip is still one of my favorite features.
"The former best Twitter app. Now it takes 5 minutes to just load the opening screen. Unusable and gone from my phone
Love the app. Wish poll questions would show up so I can vote.
Unable to authentic my accounts. Please fix!!!!!
"I purchased this a while ago
No complaints from i .
Excellent app. Best on android. Been using tweetcaster pro for a few years and cannot fault it.
I paid for the app so i wouldnt see ads.  Now i get ads in my feed. DO NOT BUY!
"Great
It's dead. No longer developed.
"Can't see or respond to surveys
Great Clem tweeting
A new addiction!
lotsa of great features but mind-bogglingly ugly. use the trial to see if it suits
Retweet option gone from my LG G4 and Nexus 9
not working good all my apps working just tweetcaster .. always time out
Great app
"Used it several devices
I used to love this app but now I can't figure out how to do most of the features in Twitter like liking a tweet instead of favoriting. I can't see when someone likes my responses or tweets and I can't retweet with a comment because the character count is over replies are clunky everything is garbage I'm getting a different app.
This app would be 5 star worthy if you could send media messages in DM. Why pay for an app to replace the one I have if it can't even do everything the original Twitter app can. Please add in this feature. I shouldn't have to switch back and forth from this app to Twitter. Need media sending features in DM.
"This is a good Twitter client (I have the Pro version) but it's not perfect. The formatting of content is excellent... very compact
"Great but one BIG issue
A great way to use Twitter.
Can't see pictures of tweets or avatars. Keeps saying failure to load data.
Love this app.!
"It's back! Things are suddenly much better. Thank you! I've been missing this app so much.  Nice upgrade but feed is sticking
Use everyday
What happened to DMs? I get an error code 403 that says the app can not access or delete my Direct Messages.
"I love this app and have used it for years on my phone and tablet. BUT there is still flickering when new tweets arrive on my Samsung S5mini and Nexus 7 which is very annoying.  19.5.17 This has been dragging on a long time now
I love the format
if it possible we can see the polls ?
Love it. Used for years now.
"Works pretty well.. Widget is a bit shaky
So many useful features that Twitter hasn't even figured out to give us on their own official app! Worth every penny!
"Still the best twitter client I've used that I find any other difficult and too messy to use 
hoping to enjoy this
Full twitter features + searches & trends. Nice! @jtatex in San Diego!
"I PAID for this app because I loved it. It had different customizable​ options and you could choose the colors of the timeline
"Fabulous! Rapid
Does the job well.
"was five stars until my Samsung S8 came along
Best one
"So I've been using Tweetcaster for a while. Through the good & the bad. It has its good. Pros: very customizable. Love the color themes. I love the picture avatar preview in the tweets. Cons: will rate higher if this is ever fixed
Excellent twitter client. I will never go back.
"Hi there
"Once I load more tweets
"Hey
"Finally supports quote tweets. But doesn't show them in the Replies tab. So easy to miss if someone quotes you. Also needs to show follows
Always liked the app
"Need some updates
Needs update. Polls have been there for more than a year and still not supported.
Still my preferable Twitter app. I like the features. Still wish I could see who has liked my tweets in it. They do a pretty good job updating it so that it handles different media
Love it
"great app
"Allows configuration of multiple accounts
If it had the ability to arrange lists it would be a 5 star app.
I use Twitter for news. Best Twitter app I use.
Many annoying bugs with notification system.
I love it. Just wish I could edit my spelling mistakes
Snappy and cool. Really enjoying it on my BlackBerry Dtek50
"Every touch of a tweet should be as if you hit ""conversation"". Too cumbersome to see what any tweet is in regard to currently. As is
"Included functionality not available in any other Twitter app I've found. Unfortunately
28/6/2013- yeay!!! thanks! My favourite twitter app!!!   This was my favourite twitter app. I loved it so much i bought the app. The interactions button is what made me love it. AND I BOUGHT IT TWICE. as my phone was reformated.  I like to see who retweets me who follows me and stuff. Interactions button is good. WHY DID U HAVE TO REMOVE IT? SIGH. BRING IT BACK AND I'LL GIVE A BETTER RATING. Was probably the best twitter app before you removed the interactions button. BRING IT BACK PLEASE.  I havent been able to post pics on tweetcaster. Its so frustrating. Giving it 3 stars now. It was once a worthy 5 stars. 👎👎👎 please fix that
Easy app to use with no ads.
"It's simple
Why is there not an option to 'Mute' a user??? All else is good! 😁 Update 2.17.17- can you bring the phone font option back. I love when apps use my phone font. Thanks in advance! ✊
"It's been perfect
"unfortunately the app has stopped working MSG comes up a lot still. I've cleared cache
The extras and the no ads is definitely worth the lil money I paid. Should make it compatible with facebook though.
"Good
"Completely unusable
Great app much better than the official app
No ads! Awesomeness!
Tweetdeck cumple con lo que necesito para gestionar mis cuentas de Twitter
This has made using Twitter tolerable.
Please make it gif-friendly!
Great app. Wish FB links would open in Android app rather than browser.
This is the stupidest app ever. Don't get this app. Just have the twitter app. It works just fine. Nothing this app does helps at all. It's annoying
Good app faster and less app crush than official tweeter.
Best Twitter client out there.  Great price for the pro version too.
Excellent App
"Improved quite a bit
Works well.
Good all round Twitter client
Use to love this app but now everything I retweet doesn't get sent and comes up with a 404 error code.
Best twitter app I've used!
Simple and suits my needs. I love the fact that I can post long tweets very easily. .
Keeps freezing!
"Don't buy it
Favorite Android Twitter app by far.
App does not work properly on swiping multiple twitpics
"I bought this for the dark theme. But when I reply to a tweet
"Bought it a long time ago
Pictures don't load anymore
"I'm not a twitter fan in the first place
I have always preferred this app over the Twitter app.
"I like the ability to create how my stream
The main reason for buying this app was it's ability to post to Facebook which now is broken.
"Alerts still broken and unable to go to look at profiles without black screen of death. Sometimes hitting back will load the profile
Its annoying to read my timeline and it flickers every ten seconds.
"I'm not give 5 stars
BEST TWITTER APP ON THE MARKET!
"I can't use a whole pic in my header! It keeps cutting off the pic at the neck..it also won't allow me to change my avatar..& bring back the @feature where it would pull anybody's name up
"Want to love this app but cannot save searches for some reason
Why am I getting redirected to a Readability app that is defunked
Doesn't autocomplete user handles or hashtags. Doesn't show hashtag counts. For a paid app is pretty bad
"A nice app
Very good. Is there a way to copy the link to a tweet?
"it was Best 
"Why am I not able to see the number of remaining characters when tweeting in DM? And why isn't my profile synced across all platforms: phone & tablet? I'm signed in on both via Google
"I've noticed that in the timeline sometimes when i open the app i have like 500-600 new tweets
I guess with the latest update things have messed up with the app.  It immediately gives me an error upon trying to open it.  The option to retry comes up which also does nothing.  LG V20
"when I go to send a tweet the User name doesn't auto populate. I have to go back and remember it.  I'm deleting until fixed
Always erorr cod404  .. If i wanna coppy smothing .. Sometimes not able to copy ! …  try to add new option such as download vedio and GPF  ..
Good build. Most of the issues from the last build appear fixed.
Thank you for updating the best twitter client 😍😎
"This used to be a great app. In some ways
Been using this and prefer this to twitter 😊
"Every once in a while I'll find something that bugs the h*ll out of me
Not the prettiest kid on the block but efficient and versatile in its layout and possibilities. Foregoing comment is a year old and I stopped using it till lately. It's lack of updating was being felt (wondered whether this paid version had been abandoned). However with the latest update all appears well again.
"Since the latest update
"Much more functional and useful than the official Twitter app
Does exactly what I need with more than 140 characters option for Twitter
"Keep on saiding error  please fix it. Its still doing
Still the best Twitter app for Samsung Android phone!
Tweeting slows down drastically when there's a major event. During presidential debates it was insufferable.
"Now tweets are slow to load
The best
This is not crowned king for that reason. Speed will drive customers crazy in frustration. The twitter stock app is even worse.  Before you buy read our full unbiased review at samfiel.co.uk on TweetCastor Pro
Love it
"Since last update
How do I see my followers / following? The instructions on the faq don't work. If i can't manage these easily it's useless.
Does all I need on twitter
"It'd have ""light bubbles "" with other colors besides blue
You can customize it  the UI looks fresh and new. Great for the eyes.
"Playing tweet video become a dream in this app
Excellent Twitter app
"Can't view people's tweets
Love this app but just recently every time i try to save a link to pocket to read later the tweetcaster app closes down
Been using this app for a while..
"Now feels dated. No option to auto play gifs and an interface that used to be practical back when Twitter was more limited
Great stuff
There is no refresh button on widget anymore What happened?
Let's see if things are better with this app
Love it

"I am saving a lot of pic from twitter. And tweetcaster is the best at this job. And of course
"I absolutely love this app. I've been using it for years now

Why can't clicking a URL take you straight to a website? Why do we need readability? Answer these questions and earn 2 stars
"So much wrong after latest update. When are the fixes coming? I honestly don't like any other twitter platforms on my phone.. please let us know some expected dates for fixes from the last update. Ect.
Been using it a long time.... Works like a charm.... Easy to use..... Easy to see.... Just great. Always go back to TweetCaster!
"For some reason the tweet view widget is no longer showing the home
"Loved this app before. But the most recent update now makes it so that if I want to click on my profile (I have a locked account) to view my past tweets
The app after the new update is not performing well on Not 4
"Works well on my droid. Like the extra features. EDIT: one star after app crashes on purpose when trying to follow the President elect.  Poor taste
"Suddenly it starting flickering
Annoying notifications
Great app for personalized  news. The search function needs improvement.  The opinion and hate-filled tweets need to be filtered out somehow.
"Been using this for years
"I've used tweetcaster for years and loved it. This latest update however is completely broken. Can't view anything from protected accounts even when following them. I tried reinstalling the app to see if that helps and now I can't even sign back into my twitter accounts. It's constantly stuck on ""contacting twitter"". So no I have a completely unusable app that I paid good money for!"
Tweetcaster works for me from a design viewpoint.
"I have two major problems. One is that I am constantly getting notifications from old tweets.  Like every few hours from a tweet from a week ago
Crashes everytime I select URL and choose instapaper read later service. Is ok if that is chosen as default in tweetcaster settings. Please fix
Best Twitter app ever.
"I wouldn't use Twitter if it weren't for Tweet Caster. The TL is very clean and easy to scroll to the spot that you want to begin and the newest update allows a ""quote tweet"" function
Been great until last update and now can't see tweets from users who are protected even when we follow each other.  That's a serious problem that needs a quick fix as app unusable now
Best app for twitter
Been using Tweetcaster for over 3 years now and love it. Needs a fix however. It doesn't let me view the tweets or favorites of private users even though I'm following them. Also would like to see a polls feature. And please bring back who favorites your tweets in interactions. Still the best Twitter App out there and it's not close
Screen flickering since latest update !
Sucks my battery dry!
This is the best Twitter app that I've tried. Lots of customization.
"I'm using this for almost as long as I'm on Twitter since 2012. Compared with the 'official' Twitter app this gives you a clean Twitter feed without ads (at least in the Pro version) or annoying 'suggestions'. It (finally) now also supports quoted Retweets. Minor bugs: Occasional screen flicker and an error message 'Failed to load data' on pictures
Screen continues to flick. Annoying!
CAN U PLEASE FIX THE FLICKERING THAT HAPPENS WHEN NEW TWEETS COME IN?? IT IS VERY ANNOYING AND I CANT TAKE IT ANYMORE!!!!! CAN YOU PLEASE RESPOND TO MY QUESTION?? PLEASE HELP!!
"Twitter changes hurt tweetcaster for a while.  Recent updates have returned it to being my favorite Twitter app: easy to use
Simple and Awesome app for Twitter. Been using it for last 4 yrs. Only thing missing is group chat and polls. Hope you will add it soon.
The best just got better - now with long tweet support. Whoopee!
Makes you think youre stuck in 2006
Everytime I have to download the tweets (gap)
"Finally got quote tweet
"You make this application worse with your ""improvements"" to the UI.  Then completely ignore feedback.  This app was great
"So glad this has finally been updated
"Support tailed off and broke
"Love this app and have used for a long time for twitter feed. However
You guys finally did an update but unfortunately it has ruined the app. The app just jumps all over the screen. It flickers like a faulty light bulb before it blows.
Flickers every time i receive a new tweet.....?
Handles large number of follows well but doesn't do well with threaded tweets.
Recently came back to twitter and always used this app. It just does what I want it to. Superb work.
Yay
Why are users who are zipped not appearing on mentions? Bring back that feature again since I still talk to them
New update is causing glitches with every new tweet. Not smooth refresh. Plz correct to bring back up to 5☆
As of late with the new update the screen flickers every single time a new tweet comes through. Very annoying!
I would like to say how very satisfied I am with your program thanks what an  awesome job you did created it
The best app for tweeter
Tweetcaster pro
A long overdue update! Hooray!
I can't believe that i can't upload videos on Twitter unless i have YouTube account. Destroying your great app by something so silly. I have to use other apps to upload videos. Stupid
Very happy that this client is useable again. The one improvement I would like would be to be able to follow a link in one tap rather than two.
"Everything pretty much working again
"A huge huge thank you to the developers of this fantastic app
"Do not download this rapidly failing app. I was about to say ""Will you hurry up with the latest update
Sin duda el mejor
"This app is abandoned by the developer. The app crashes every now and then
Tried so many different twitter apps but keep coming back to this one. Still the best.
Was well worth the money. Like the options and look.
Great app
Great app but it needs a whole new make over. Wish it was more like the twitter app expect with the ads
"Easy to use
"This used to be the best twitter app
Videoes doesn't always play. I have to rely on other apps or browsers to play the videos
"This was always my favorite app
My tablet finally upgraded to Lolipop and now my Tweetcaster Pro widget has disappeared and I cant find it anywhere. How do I get it back?
Doesn't seem to have implemented the recent twitter changes meaning many of the tweets on my time line are truncated with a URL meaning I end up reading them in a browser. Seriously needs sorting out.
"I cant remember the last time this app was updated
This seems to be taking a long time to address.
Some nice features and pretty smooth. For $5 though you should be able to see who favorites your tweet.
"Interface that requires more taps to perform simple actions than the official app

"Where's the new update? Can't read tweet because now they are ignoring  picture
It's good
The best twitter app imo.
This used to be the best twitter app even so I bought the paid version just to be let down. It takes over 3 minutes to get a tweet or dm. I want my money back.. the few perks are being able to post on facebook and twitlonger other than that get the free version
"Was the best twitter app out there
Changing apps until the truncated tweet issue is resolved.
Works great

This app hasn't been updated in over a year. It's missing key changes to Twitter and causes things to not work properly.
Selected text and cursor do not appear in Midnight display. Can y'all please review this matter?
"I hope the Dev team is working on making the new Twitter changes of ignoring the attachment
"Tweetcaster gives me a lot of nice features that the regular Twitter app doesn't have. However
I love Tweetcaster.
"Wish the UI would be updated to Material Design
The most convenient twitter app!
Now looking dated/tired
Just hope they update soon considering twitter has changed tweet length etc.
I enjoy using this
"Upgraded to pay version
please tell me how I remove ads on my paid Pro app! thx
So is it time to say goodbye tweetcaster or you will updrae it soon? We want to know!

My favorite 3rd party Twitter app! ❤️🐦
"I bought this because it was the best Twitter app and I loved the features.  Now that they have my money
nice app
Excellent
Best Twitter app
Nice
Awesome
Search function is broken. Still no polls. Very slow to load. Splash screen is annoying. No update in almost a year. I can only assume they're making so much money from ads and in app purchases that pro users are ignored.
Waste of money! Want my money back!
1. twit longer is gone 2. location gps button in corner of tweet box no longer works
"Still like the app
Brilliant app. Excellent zip it feature that works really well
"App hangs
"It's ok
"Don't waste your money. Sure this is a fantastic app and I've always used it and sung it's praises
Been using it for years. Nothing compares
The ui is superb. Easy to use even for 5 years old kids.
https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GhecZPlWbeviBWcIW4VpPUInKLmtOOFgdBzmw8LT9w
Much improved since last update but lacking the 'quote tweet' option which funnily us available on the free version. Otherwise would be a 5 star rating 👀
Still using this app simple and elegant.
This is the best Twitter app I've come across.
"I love this app & use it over twitter
Its amazingly beautiful and easy to use!
I've paid for the pro (never even used the free version) and can't use it. Screen becomes unresponsive and turns black! Please help!
It's good but has a few bug's from time to time.
Can't currently recommend as it hasn't been updated for around a year (and maybe never will be again). Some key Twitter features are therefore missing. It used to be good but I'll now be switching to an alternative.
"I'm not sure why
"Have been using this app for a few years
"Seriously? I thought the paid version was supposed to be an upgrade. Why is this feature
Otherwise it's great. Everything you could need. Biggest convenience: being able to selectively cross-post to Facebook on a per tweet basis.
No ads
"When a better one comes along
Would be 5 stars If you added more themes PLEASE!!!
"Two phones later
So much better than the stock app for Twitter. Plus a good widget.
"I love the dark theme
Lately i have been having lots of problems showing images and videos.  I log into Twitter using a web browser and the images and videos show up quickly.  It's time for an update.
Can't view polls.  It doesn't even indicate when there is a poll which can be confusing.
This app has an outdated look and is in need of a definite overhaul
Blocking function no longer works. Been broken for a while now! The freeze ups while scrolling are finally unbearable. uninstalled!
Best app ever
"I miss using an external Web browser
I have about every Twitter app available. I still think TweetCaster is better than Plume and Uber but it loses style points against the original Twitter app. You can't vote in polls or create one. It's still good managing multiple accounts but it does leave a lot to be desired. This was the first Twitter app buy used and I've kept it because it allows me two post from my business account and Facebook simultaneously. But over the last seven years it is no longer my favorite. And your boy bought the premium 1
worth the $...  i can sign into both of my accounts and tweet.
Please enhance app to support Twitter polls
When this application first came out it was top of the line now it has fallen way behind times they need to release updates that release new features
Better than original twitter for me
Great app!!!
"Why is the quote feature available on the FREE version and not the PAID for ""PRO"" version?!   This is asinine. Will change rating once fixed."
Tweetcaster Pro is the way to go!
Have to force close the app to get it to update.
It works for me...
"This app need to fix the Arabic alignment
Abandoned
Best client for Android. New 'phone install and Tweetmarker now operates perfectly.
"No updates the app has been abandoned
"Will not load on my wife's phone.  Says ""Tweetcaster has shout down"" even after reinstall"
v goooooood
"Great Features
It keeps freezing and i bought the upgrade one
Awesome
there is no update for the paid version.
The app was good but does not keep up with new Twitter features such as liking tweets and twitter polls. Starting looking for a new app which does these.
"Why on the App I PAID for isn't there an option to ""quote"" a tweet like there is on the free app? I use that feature A Lot
DM sometimes will not delete right a way. Have to uninstall then reinstall to delete
Won't let me post any attachments. What a joke? Can't believe I paid for this.
Glitches here &  there. Wish they would put quoting in the app
Love this Twitter client. I upgraded for the falcon pro that is not supported anymore but still usable. This is better than stock. Five stars
I'm happy with it
Could never update my own profile and since ive become more active its a major problem
"Works much faster and smoother than the free version. Some minor notification issues
Always updating to stay at the top - I love Tweetcaster!
Needs material design and better quoted tweet support. No update since Sept. 2015. Wake up!
"I'm using it few years already and as I'm really satisfied
Needs to be updated asap
Best Twitter app out.
"After a long time using it as a free version
ain't it time to update this app?
"But now I post one tweet and it hits the limits twice in a row (Two dialogs
Almost 5 stars.  Needs better dark theme.  Totally black... Not charcoal black.
I'm giving 5 stars when enable mute button and group DMs.
Where is the Quote option??
"App use to be perfect.. So many issues with it now
Nice to see all the bugs have been ironed out. Couldn't live without it.
Great app
Long time I have used this program its the best. But we need Update so we can vote… like the original twitter
Can't attach or load  pictures with some services.
This hasn't been updated in almost a year. This app has no support for quoting tweets or polls or any of the recent twitter features. GUI is old and outdated. It is not enough anymore. Are you guys planning an update or have you given up?
Integration with Twitlonger is missing from my app.
Just what the doctor ordered. Fast and smart.
This used to be the best twitter app around but now it's fallen so far behind everything else. Now basic things like commenting on quotes/retweets aren't possible and it's probably not even worth it to mention everything else. This only thing this app has over others is the zip it feature.
"If I tweet with exactly 0 characters remaining
"To see if errors [FC's] stop.  Have used Tweet caster for many
If any day in any update they will fix the detect gap after timeline refreshes it will be the perfect twitter app
"Love it
Good app but can't play twitter videos
Still can't quote tweet? How ridiculous is that? Please improve the app before we paid users move on.
Love it
Great App
Fine program...
Nice and easy to use .
Very Distracting
Can no longer save pictures
Quickly swap accounts. Posting is very smooth and easy.
"I bought this version
"I have had the app for a couple years
It doesnt open on Nexus 5x
Seems like this doesn't get updated any more sadly
Good one
Thankz
"After I decided to support this app it has stopped updating since forever
"Most user friendly Twitter client I've used
"I can no longer send tweets with pix attached. Any time I try I get a ""failed to send"" message. I went into my app  permissions and made sure everything was enabled
Good app. Been using it for yrs.  Needs some attention. Maybe an UPDATE!!!
I use it daily.
"Have been a long time user
♥ everything about this app other than that I can't quote a tweet. Otherwise I'd give 5 🌟
Awesome
"The block feature seems not to be working at all.  Annoying but still I'd rather it worked.  Also I noticed the quote feature is not here on the pro version? Other than those two things
"Hasn't been updated since last September. Very glitchy on Marshmallow. Almost everything you do causes your timeline to reload
Wonderful!
Perfect
I have been using this for 5 years. Loved it so much I got the pro version. The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because I have to periodically (about twice a year) do a complete uninstall  due to extreme delays for certain functions.
This app saved me from the standard twitter app
Does everything I need it to do.
"I've been using this for years and have had no issues with it at all.   Interface is good
I cant see ppl that quote my tweet in my mentab. Thats annoying. How to refund this?
"Hate the icon/logo
Very happy with this app does everything I need it to do.
The ad removal isn't worth it when you take features away. Add quoting to the paid. Doesn't make sense that it isn't available.
"I know that some will prattle on about ""Not enough features"" or ""Rudimentary design"" or some such other nonsense. But know this:  I am an avid tester and assessor of all things. And of this you can be certain. Tweetcaster Pro is the best Twitter app out there right now. It combines all the features I (as a 30something Tweeter) need. Whether
"There are certain features and conveniences missing. For example
Routinely crashes and 10 second freeze after closing a picture or link.
Nice :)
Best out there
Tweet caster is letting me catch up with all the tweets and it's getting me back again to twitter
Much better than generic app.
Better
I think that's the best twitter app ever
Works fine!
Update: I still see Tweetcaster has not fixed the notifications.Needs to add the quote a tweet function from twitter. Does not update the list correctly. Great start though. Also push notifications are not real time. They are delayed quite substantially.
The widget doesn't work when I move to the SD Card. Follow me at HighlyFa4d.
Handle. Easy to use. Love it!!
Been using for years. But why I'd the free version a better version than this paid one? Why can't I quote on the Pro version!?!
Horrible waste of money. Crashes far more than every program/application combined I have ever used in my entire life. Slow/Crashing/Freezing
Better than the official twitter app!
this app is becoming slower and slower.  also it won't play snappy TV so I have to open regular Twitter app if I want to look at videos.  looking for a new Twitter app
Pretty app.
Constantly freezes on my Note5 or LGv10. Can't handle large followings. Even with one account on it with a moderate following keeps freezing. Definitely NOT worth any money.
"Does well
"The search and list functions are far superior to the official Twitter app. The dark background option is also a welcome alternative to the Twitter app's  white-only option. The timeline does feel a bit cluttered
Allows enough info to come across but not over loading you.
Awesome App
"A few minor issues
I love this app for twitter. Much better then the twitter app
"Giving you all the tools to tweet on the go
The perfect Twitter app!
"Had to replace it
"I get a lot of incoming tweet mentions and such. The big problem is if someone deletes a mention then mentions again
Love the fact that it actually flags me when I or my friends post a tweet. I would give it a full 5 stars if it didn't load with that logo.
Best twitter client I've seen.
"Good feel and features
The best
Used daily
"I encounter errors when trying to upload pics attached to tweets. I close out of the app
Easy fo organize multiple account
It just works!
"I've been searching for a fantastic Twitter app on Android for a very long time
No need to look further.
I started using Tweetcaster back when I was still using a Droid X. Still love it now that I am on my Moto X Pure.
now is back to normal . Thx alot !
Best of the best
"Not working now
"Nice app
"I can't signing in because ""Can't connecting to Twitter"" problem but other twitter app I use works perfectly. Is this I get for buying pro app?"
TEDJA MUSIK
"Nicely laid out and lots of options to process tweets. STILL needs ability to quote tweets now that twitter has added this useful feature
Always freezing  Doesn't work with wifi
Rare and almost useless updates. I got back to Twitter app and it is much better. Tweetcaster now looks like an old man among other twitter apps.
It made it easier for me to use Twitter and helped me organize my newsfeed. I hope that it has a way of linking to Instagram in the future though.
Muy buena excelente Actualización! :D lo compre sólo para sacar la publicidad x.x
Not even pretending to be a modern Twitter app any more. I have moved on to Talon.
Love it!!
Like the black background format
Great twitter client that pretty much does everything you need with handy included plug-ins.
Wish you could just have it pinned to the top all the time for real time tweets. Similar to how it's done on the tablet version
"Pretty good BUT if I add #at the beginning of a tweet
Sardine
Loads your whole timeline. If you read it... I do. Official app loads an hour at peak times. Best app IMO.
This app is awesome.
"Or give me a refund. For 2 years now the splash screen occasionally just locks up and doesn't allow the app itself to be shown
"Why is the ability to quote a tweet on the free version but not the paid? We can view quoted tweets now
I've tried a few Twitter clients.  I recently came back to Tweetcaster.  It seems to suit me best.
Now won't allow refresh from bottom on tablet.
"This is the best Twitter app that I've found thus far.  I like that you can customize themes
Fav twitter app
Nice app!
Easy to use!
Good app
"Any 3rd party social media app should be at least as good as the default client. This one does a terrible job with conversations (one of the most important parts of Twitter IMO) and hides the obvious actions (retweeting
"Love it. Works the way twitter should
Best app I've run into for tweets
~Excellent!
"Hello
"This needs to change. I loved the app before but I see more and more posts that include polls
متوافق مع الناطق
Best Twitter app.
Very good...
"I don't buy a lot of apps
lots of features choices make this apps simply stands out from the other. very easy to manage many accounts. super light to use. worth every penny spent. definitely this app is a solid 5/7
"Only gave 3 stars because there is no quote tweets feature
And very customizable. Tried some others and keep coming back to this one.
Keeps crashing
I love this app but it gets a 2 until they make an update that allows me to view polls
The best twitter app out there except that is slower
"The best twitter app because it provides RT with comments
Most previous issues have been resolved.
"Intrusive permissions
I logged in to be greeted with a window stating that it would still use data in the background even when closed. Uninstalled it right away.
"Sign in does not work. It's probably something Twitter has done
"Will vote it ahead of Fenix and Talon. But
Don't know why but not been able view all my lists app seems to stall or just not refresh for a while now. Moved to Talon much better.
It is the best Twitter app around #GrapeApe Still love you 😘
Suits my needs perfectly
Dont spend your money here
Awesome
Paid for the app. Unable to view replies and view photos. Reached out to company via Twitter and email. No response. This is the second and last time I will pay for an app. Complete BS and not even worth it. You can't even post a long tweet. You can now do this on Twitter.
Works beautifully.
Its really much better than the basic twitter app
I can't disable Readability! Very annoying!
"Nearly perfect. There are all features Ubersocial for Android
Very easy to use. Lots more you can do. I'd love to have a photo capability in the DM section though.
"great app
Why is this version updated so slowly compared to free version. Upgrading to this actually made me lose some functionality.
I love it! Pro is the way to go!
"The best twitter app I've ever used. Complete features and easy to use. But
GG
I'll give 5 star if tweetcaster can read/open/see pict on direct message!
Needs work but it's ok
Best Twitter app
Good apps until now
"Notifications have finally been fixed
"Just perfect! Way better than the official Twitter app. Love that they added a bigger list of trending topics
"Force restarting my Note 2. Can't auto reconnect after ""flight mode"". Can't open YouTube links with YouTube app or browser so I can't favorite
O melhor!
All you need to communicate through twitter.
"So far so good
Notifications dont work and tweetcaster refuses to help or refund.
I love this app better than Twitter app
The most user friendly
"How do you quote tweet???? Not quote as in the old RT quote thing
Way quicker now after the resent update!
"Works great
Wonderful app
I missed it so much when I had a Windows phone
Great app
Works like a charm.
This is hands down the best app for Twitter.
Love this app features ect but needs a gui update. Look at talon needs material design look and feel. Other than that amazing
Runs like a tweeta...takes a tweeting n keeps on tweecking...
Love it
Used this app for a while and now it won't update or install. I want my money back
"UPDATE: tried the official twitter app for 4 months. really wanted to like it but it simply can't compete with tweetcaster pro. no question. among other features
Best twitter ap
This is far and away the best twitter app I have tried. You can really personalise it and it's easier to use. Plus at the moment it still has the old star/favourite rather than the heart/like Facebook nonsense! Excellent.
Es excellent quality :)
"Excellent app. Multi functions makes tweeting quick
"I am pleased to rate this app. After trying many others
"One of the best! I love the fact there is no limit on direct messages now! Been using it since 2013 and it keeps getting better
The only Twitter app I'll use
Best app for me so far
"Love everything about the app.  Wish it would do 2 more things.  1) The ability to pick which account to favorite or retweet from.  2) Incorporate Twitter's new embedded quoted tweet retweet.  Otherwise
"Updates to functionality are super slow to occur. Otherwise really great app.  UPDATE: Switched to Fenix
"Now my default and only Twitter app. Awesome and very well done
Had Twitter for years. This is my favorite app. Worth paying for if you use it a lot.
I loved this app until recently but I am getting a lot of failed postings especially those with links and images. Once a post has failed it saves to draft. Every attempted repost fails.
Used the free version for years and decided to support the devs for their great work.
everything seems to be running smooth for me!
"This has been my favorite client for years
Best twitter client ever
Nice no nonsense add-on full of features. Runs great on sony xperia z1s
Worth it to buy it
Works as expected.
Need Notifications for the new quoted tweet style
Great tool
Refresh or reply to any DM please fix
"It has a nice look and solid set of features. DMs are not synced. If I delete a DM on the web
"Keep getting a ""too many redirects"" error when I try to login. What use is an app that you can't use? Especially one you paid for!"
"What a joke.   I was never even able to sync tweetcaster to my twitter account.   Never got a notification from twitter and when i choose to recieve a message with a code
"Tried others
"Good application. Great if your a gab
"Love this app makes using twitter much more easy and fun
Im not getting the color themes please HELP!!!
I have been a regular user of Twitcaster and have been having real problems with it. The timeline does not load at all sometimes after following an external link and has been slow to go through the Tweets when it does load.
"Just wish it had the old method for quoting tweets. I guess official Twitter app has changed too
"Type in 140 characters
"Very slow and sluggish moving between screens and on page refreshes
Why no back button on full screen image?!?!
Best twitter app ever. Only thing that needs work is the splash screen on launch. Would love to see this updated with some material design.
Great Twitter Client for android
"There are more options here than Twitter sending longer messages
Really nice.
Where is the option to post tweets to Facebook
I am now receiving duplicates of most tweets.  Just recently started and i did not change any settings.  Please fix thanks!!
Love this app. Top notch!
Love it for my s6 egde plus
The best app for twitter nice
I freezes when I open it. It looks great but I can't get past the freeze.
"Handy little app
manteblah
Tweetcaster pro
"Great feature set! Handles multiple accounts
I love this app too much
"Great app.. But not being able to use the back button on full screen images is annoying
Great Twitter app. Tried many of them and this one seems the best. Thanks for a great app.
Thank you for taking away the twit longer feature on tweets with urls/pics. I detested that. Changed my 1 star to 5.
Works great.
"Nice app
"Fast and complete
"Recently bought a Nexus 6 totally stock OS and now
"I used to be able to retweet with comment private accounts but now it won't let me. Main reason why i i left tweetcaster pro since this was on of the main reasons why I loved tweetcaster
"Wow...Fast responds for about notification error... Good Job
"I waited THREE MONTHS and two weeks for OneLouder to fix widget functionality for the Samsung Galaxy S4
"What a way to use tweeter. Amazing app and for me
ALL posts regardless of length are being truncated and sent to TweetLonger. This makes this app completely unusable now. I'm a longtime user but uninstalling now and looking for something that actually works.
Keep getting background notifications even after I turned off that option. I've been a user of the app for years but I just got so annoyed now that I've uninstalled the app.
I cannot send a tweet out for one of my accounts. It goes into the drafts...with no explanation given. If a real person is reading this please help. I've sent feedback and have not heard anything.
Not good since last update.  Tweets are within limit but won't on't send whole tweet.  Just wants to go to take you to tweet longer so they can put their adds in my tweets.  UNINSTALLED.
"It's a good app
"I can't get the new update to download. I keep getting the 489 error message. I'm afraid to uninstall it because if I try to reinstall it
"When I post links to articles within 140 characters
I just downloaded it after a factory reset and it won't stop alerting me to new tweets. Constantly buzzing. I turned off all notifications and restarted and it's still out of control. What is happening here?
Constantly crashes go & look at profiles & crashes scroll to quick &  crashes had to change & hate it
"I've used this app for years
This latest update is flawed.. Retweets with comments so not show previous pix and count is wrong.. Please go back to olderversion
Fan bloody tastic
Not as much functionality as others
Glad we finally got quoted tweets. But why oh why have you messed up with twitlonger I hate twitlonger and don't want it on my tweets as all my tweets are within 140 characters! Please turn off urgently
Waited all this time for a meaningful update only to get this obligatory tripe.  Tired of being ignored.  I've switched to Tweetings.  It's what Tweetcaster should have become.  Highly recommend it.  Won't be looking back here again.
"You fixed the reply function
Very annoying that you get notifications for everything.
Now i love it...after today update
Nice
"So far
Absolute crap
Works like a charm
"I paid for the pro version
Welp. This app is officially done. So slow. Back to Plume.
Nice!!!
This use to work on a Nexus 7 but since the update it fails to get by the splash screen.
I Stopped using it!
"Scrolling the timeline isn't always smooth
Really love the post a tweet later function
The best twitter app for Android.
I don't anything else for Twitter posting
"Very disappointed
Worth to buy
Good app with relevant controls. Do recommend it.
better than the official app
Everything one louder does is outstanding
Recommended.
Newest update needs some repairs. Before this it was better than the official twitter app.
"Except for one major problem I'm having with the ""Zip It"" feature I loved this app!  I recently  attempted to ask for help by emailing both their Google provided support email and the email provided by them on their (www) FAQ page.  Instead of help I got a canned response: ""Hello
"Can see part of the pics in timeline but clicking on them gives a blank screen
This is the 2nd phone that I've used this app on; No problems with either.
Keren banget dah
Great Apps.. Love it!
Find another app that allows you to refresh even after you BUY it.
I love this app! Have used it for about a year and have tried other twitter apps...this is definitely the best.
Users tweets doesn't work?
Great App
"I'm in love with this app! I began having a few problems with reloading
I'm very comfort use this aplication
You charged me twice.
Love this app the best one on the app store
I have foreign people on my list and they speak a different language. I won't be able to understand unless I translate it somehow. There should be support for that. Other than that the features are pretty good.
Need to make it easier to search for like minded twitters.
"After trying several other twitter apps
"would be 5 starts but Doesn't give ""@"" suggestions when typing a tweet. I don't have all ""@"" names memorized. Suggestions of popular ""@"" with what I've started to type would make this perfect"
I have a thing for bouncing between different Twitter apps but found this one to be the most full featured of any I've tried. The free version is every bit as good but I wanted to support this app so I spent a small amount on it. Definitely worth checking out.
Good
"The best apps there is out there
"Two stars for being an insatiable nagging baffoon
"Why
I live the simplicity of the app.
"If it could sync with instagram
New phone. ..will be watching memory closely. Increased from 1 star for now.
Handy for lists
Love it
Fix the picture posting error or I'm demanding my money back.  When I pay for something I expect it to work!
Guys...Goddammit. Come on. I paid for this and it's still crashing out? Come on please. AND I'M GETTING NO MENTIONS
My favorite
Works good now. Slow problem gone away
Thanks for helping stop the Retreat Time Bandit!  I simply don't have the time to wade through them!
"Can't move to another app
Unstable and unusable! Waste of money and time! Uninstalling and going to Falcon.
"Phantom tweets that repeat for hours
Pretty good!
It'll be better if I'm able to see who fav my tweet!
Tweetcaster for android is superb.
The loading of images on this application causes that it randomly scrolls up or down so that you loose the last post that you were reading. Needs some serious fixing.
Horrible customer service I bought this app due to its functionality but the last update would constantly crash.  No response back so I uninstalled. Horrible customer experience. Paying clients should at least get help we at least deserve that.
Love it...
I find it can be heavy on the battery but it's still the best. I try other Twitter clients and always come back to TC.
Great app
Great App. Excellent functionality
"Since last update
"As good as it gets. Very stable
"I have three separate twitter accounts
The interface is fugly but it works well.  Most of the time.  Great features you won't find anywhere else.
"Well designed
Title says it all
Simply what i need
"Love
Occasion problem with posting but otherwise great.
"Was once my favorite twitter app. Not so much now. Color coding still doesn't work. Now if I click a video link
Freezes too often. Also won't mass delete or mark as read the DMs from twitter. Feature freezes so hundreds  of DMs sit unless you delete each one individually.
And I love the zip it feature
Just seems to work better for me.
Great app. My one wish would be an option to mute new people I follow
TweetCaster is good though. Thank you for this. Wish it was the same kind of UI like Seesmic (God rest its soul).
Best twitter app.
"When will you add support for the new retweet-with-comment feature
Can adjust profile.
"Edit; years later and I'm back and this so had picked itself up and is whole again.      Old review            Used to be good
This is the best twitter app ever
"On my old S4
Why does it take so long to open the compose tweet screen?  I'm sorry I purchased this.  I love the ability to see others 'mentions'  please keep this feature.
Good app
"I started using the paid version and it keeps giving me the Rate Limit popup.  It is even happening when I first open the app.  Needs to be fixed.  Otherwise
Manages multiple accounts and does everything I news.
"Best app out there for twitter 
Won't open on my Samsung Galaxy S3. Uninstalled.
"Finally working again. No more freezing
OK
Deje la app oficial por tener errores en las notificaciones... Esta funciona al.100%
"Thank you so much for your work
One of the best twitter applications on here.
My favorite twitter application. Easy to used...
Photos by other users are not loading at all. Why bother updating if it makes the app worse?
This is the first app I install on a new phone. The one I read in bed.  I love being able to post to both Twitter and Facebook at once.
The Best.
"Latest update broke the ability to load previous tweets
"Barely loads old tweets now
"Love this app
It used to be amazing but after the last update it's only showing about an hours worth of tweets a day in my timeline.   Loading gaps just spin and come up empty.  The new swipe up to get the back button on images is a bit obnoxious as well.    I'll keep checking back for an update and revise my review if it starts working again.
"But the new full screen photos viewer kills the mood
"It just doesn't amaze me. For one
"Thanks Onelouder
I can no longer load previous tweets. Really useless if you want to find things posted a few hours ago. From 5 stars to 1. Switching to a different application even though I PAID for this one.
"Used to work perfect. After the most recent update..the gaps aren't downloaded. Used to be able to press ""load more"" and more tweets would load. It doesn't do that any more. And what's more the ""load more"" bar disappears. So you can't attempt to load more tweets again. So I'll have tweets from 35 minutes ago and then 4 hours ago because I can't load the tweets in the gap. It happens on updated versions of my nexus 7 and GS5."
A great app for twitter fans; more user friendly than the actual twitter app
Why is TL not showing all tweets in TL and lists.  Gaps aren't filling correctly from bottom. Unusable!
I've been lost all of the previous tweets a few days ago. It's so frustrating! Pls fix this problem ASAP!!
love it!
Terrible since last update. Won't refresh correctly.
"Favorite twitter app by far but sometimes doesn't load tweets.. The only feature that this is missing is a floating compose tweet widget! Really want to be able to get notifications for getting retweeted
Huge issue loading tweets now.
something's wrong with the app today. unable to load earlier tweets in lists. the load more doesn't load at all. please check and fix asap.
So far I really like it. Much better than the Twitter app.
Tried Evey twitter app there  is_and I always end up back with TWEETCAST
"Embedded tweets support please
Love it
Love it
Nice
This app was working fine but now hangs every time since the Jun 1st update.
love it
Tweetcaster has resumed it's former title of best Twitter app after a lengthy period of incredible lag and other problems. Now it's speedy again and still outdoes all others feature wise. Worth paying for. (S5 on Lollipop)
Totally worth the money
"Swiping could do more
"2 out of 3 of my scheduled tweets fail. I end up having to completely redo my tweet
Love It!!!
"Much better at some things than other apps I've tried. It's really still
"This is definitely one of the better Twitter apps
Overall still one of the smoother Twitter apps out there but where's the new quote system??? New quote system makes even the official Twitter app have more features than this app. How did that happen?
Has recently started going straight to the newest tweet rather than remembering your position in the timeline. Please fix.
Brilliant
"I use the color code option alot to identify tweets and user that I want highlighted. However
The only twitter client I use.  Top notch.
"Works well; update: 5.31.15: still works well
It used to be good. Now all it does is lag and freeze. Uninstall. Fix and I'll try again.
My favourite twitter app. Bought it ages ago. Well pleased :) Still going strong on my S6...improving all the time.. simply the best twitter app...loving the NEW large image previews
Good app.  But needs to improve a lot. Laggs and crashes in my OnePlus one
Good app
Thank you for the fix. You have been restored to your former 5 star attack of the androids approved glory.
"Since their last update
I've used Tweetcaster for years and it's only got better.  I like how it's easy to switch between 2 accounts.
Very nice
Still waiting for the new update...My tweets still wont go from twitter to facebook
Api issue seems to be fixed. 😊
"Same as many others review about the latest version of TweetCaster
"Need improvement for logo
Purcheased!it can only get better
Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't.  Often times it seems to post my tweets twice in the timeline but when I go to my tweets it only shows up once.  Please fix. Update...I am no longer able to cross post my tweets to Facebook.
Best twitter client there is
"The most important function of a twitter app imo is remembering where I last read. This app struggles with that. Even after doing everything the company recommends it still only remembers half the time. I'm just wondering why you have to jump through hoops for it to remember
System reports the app is a drain on the battery. The app is not in compliance. The app is an enemy of the An-droid. You- will- obey! Or- you- will- be- exterminat-ed!
I loatheeee when it puts me in time outs for 10 minutes at a time. That's so annoying.
"Awesome app. Current version sucks up battery fast enough to make my phone hot
This app is work than Twitter own app.
Send to Facebook
One of the better Twitter apps.
Ridiculously high battery usage after latest update. Uninstalled
I've been using TweetCaster for about 2½ years now and it's still my absolute favorite. The widget options for the Pro version makes it stand out even more for me. It looks great on my Samsung Galaxy Note Edge running Android 5.0 Lollipop.
"Best Android twitter client by far & one of the very few apps I got the paid version of. I would be lost without my interactions button & incorporating lists into the timeline seamlessly. Great app. Only complaint is that since the 9.x update
"Google gives me this update shortly after I open the app
My app doesn't show an update even though I noticed it has been updated on may 9th and 14th. It is still on 9.0 while I noticed that 9.1.2 is out
I can't color code users anymore and everything I fav doubles
"I have unistalled then re-installed the app
"I just like it better than the actual Twitter app
"This blows every other Twitter API out of the water! Themes
"My favorite twitter app. Latest update fixes the issue with TL jumping to the top
Nice
"Started out fine although slow and eventually after time isn't usable. Even though I have Pro it still lags
"Better solution to viewing RT links. A more streamlined view of reply options instead of having a screen long menu of options. Still a 5 star app
Latest improvements are great. Works really well now.
Probably the best Twitter app I've used.
Best twitter app I've used. It has some amazing features and easy to use.
The last 2 updates have crapped up what had been a good app. I can rate this  app no higher than 1 star.
"Hello
WHAT HAPPENED?!?
Been using this for years. With most recent update the refresh settings no longer work it always refreshes at the top no matter what. Also doesn't let you load all the tweets you missed like it used to do. New update is total fail!!
Application
"For current version
I love the customization of this app! My favorite way to use Twitter
Because what we really need is just the details.
Made a wrong decision in purchasing it.
Best Twitter App
The best app ever!
"Lots more features
Its great
Twitter app too buggy in android so this is a brilliant alternative. Nice layout and customisable!
It is simple to use and it always works
"I tried Twitter and Seesmic and this not only beats them
Great for spanning the brink between two social media platforms.
Can't upload pictures or attachments still! 4/29/15. Note 2 4.4
Simply the best app for twitter
Good reliable app
Great app
"Lags sometimes but love this app
Awesome
ممتاز جدا
"By FAR the best Twitter client that I've used! I was using the free one but knew after a day of use that buying the pro version would be worth it! Just a beautiful
"Use this app for me it's so simple but cool. So simple for write the tweet
Solid App
Every version just gets better
By far the best app I've used for Twitter. It's themes are awesome and it's features are the best. Only negative is that I can't seem to be notified when someone new follows me. (I'm sure they will change that)  till then 4 stars.
Latest update has ruined the Zip It feature. Now zips the Twitter client as a while instead of the single tweeter or trend. Not able to view group dms  is annoying.  Happy the picture viewing issues seem to be fixed. I will love this app forever simply for the zip feature.
"Love this App
"Best app for searches
"Since the last update I keep getting repeat notifications every 5 minutes
Tweets keep failing every time I try to send them through to Facebook and Twitter
"Love this app
But missing material design.
"Very good. Little options because it is so perfect. Smooth
Excellent
"I have used Tweetcaster as my top Android Twitter app basically since I got an android phone a handful of years ago. I have always loved the customization and the fact that it consistently worked well. Now they have fixed the only complaint I had - used to be if I clicked on a tweet in the widget
Works and looks great on the Galaxy S6 Edge
Great app.
I dig this app everything works well except the favorites in interactions. It doesn't show the user that favorites you and when you tap it takes you to favstar which also doesn't show who favorites you (unless you pay for their premium service presumably). Besides that great app.
Can I get a hell yea??
I like it. A lot better than the official app
Simply put the best twitter app out there! Nothing else comes close.
Best twitter app
Amazing customizations and extra features which makes it best stand alone app for Twitter.
Been using it for years now! Hope we could manually set how many hours we want to Zip It and it'll be perfect!
I don't want them for Twitter! I get notifications constantly... Several times a minute in every minute of every day. Is it better to just change settings to 'manual refresh'?
"The big boss of all twitter apps but in new update u used too much of the top screen
Working like its supposed tooo
Love this app.. the only change I would make is once I open the app to start at the top other than that it's amazing!!
Loving the app again.
I would like to think that the widget would work having paid for this. Nexus 6.
Some things don't just work like they used to.
Tons better then Twitter!
Thee greatest tweet app ever
"I just THOUGHT this was a POS on my HTC One M8; I can't even log on with my Samsung Note 4. ""Something is technically wrong - thank you for noticing. .."" If there's anything worse than a POS app that doesn't work
Suddenly all vines stopped working. It's like the link is broken. Tried original twitter app and there they work. Tried to reinstall but didn't help. Fix pls or tell me what I'm suddenly doing wrong.
So cool best I seen in awhile
Vine and YouTube no longer have video thumbnails
best ever!!!
Latest update crashes all the time.
still the most feature rich twitter app for andriod. I recommend this app over any other mobile twitter app.
This is the last bad Twitter client that I've tried on Android. It does the job and is less annoying than Twitter's own client.
Vines that show up in my feed are not loading or showing up at all.. It use to work fine.. Fix it the vine
It needs to exit application option. Other than that great app update.
The number one app for Twitter.
"This is the paid version of TweetCaster
"This app runs like trash on my Droid Maxx. I get excited for updates because I was once an avid fan and boycotted Twitter. But these days this app seems like store too much data. It is slow when posting a tweet
"I've had a lot of problems in the past with it freezing & crashing
Now the biggest complaint I have is the zip it feature zips the entire trend I am viewing when I have selected specifically what I want to zip.  I go back and unchecked the terms etc. I want to show and it shows the stuff I wanted zipped.  Other than that it's a great app.  3 stars only because this zip it feature is something I was using all the time. (Pretty major to me)
Yes
Constantly freezes up. Images not viewable in feed. A disaster with more bugs than a rent by the hour motel room.
Too Much screen at top now being used!!    Dislike a lot
Since the last update Vine videos do not play or show up on my TIMELINE. It's been almost a week not. Not sure what the hold up is but please fix!
No hassle
It's pretty solid. Just hoping they're are a few more tweeks coming soon.
Good work
"Love ❤ the layout and ease of Use
"Works really well
"New update took more space. Not really useful. Please reconsider to make it smaller
"The newest update seems to use even more screen space for the top UI toolbars
Working so much better!
Great user interface. Still my favorite Twitter app
Cool
No Longer Use!
After giving me error 403 for an hour the issues of sending tweets has been fixed.  5 stars
Let me actually send tweets. I'm sick of the constant failing
Timeline won't refresh. (14 hours at time if review)
Great!
I always had to have the native Twitter app on my phone because this app was very slow at publishing. This has improved 100% and is now my only Twitter client. *Fast and extremely feature rich* Totally worth paying to support development. They finally got it right =]
so far it's easy to get around and it's cute but how do you see mentions?
Does exactly what I need
I love it
its bad app since update lollipop it doesnt work.dont buy it .bad bad frozing not work
"Couldn't apply widget after moving app to SD card. Extremely fast response to my email. Do not to move to SD card if applying widget. Quick
"Loop the vine videos automatically. More notifications needed. Followers
Gif playback is glitchy and doesn't loop. The header takes up too much space. Fix it and I'll give you those two stars back.
Wont let me post tweets or pictures
With every update I think there's hope for this app lol if they could eventually fix the freezing and the force closing this app would be great
"Long time user
Yea!
Great app
Widget?
"Finally Fixed It! Took a while to address all the recent bugs
From 1 star to five stars 👍
"Has a lot of cool features
I definitely like this better than the default Android twitter app. Easy to use and feature rich. Sometimes slows down and needs to be reinstalled
Love it!!! Great app.
This makes Twitter so easy to use. I really enjoy using this app.
Latest update does not stream incoming tweets reliably. There are large gaps between tweets. The new toolbar is also much larger and very distracting.
"There is too much wasted space at the top there
"Bought Tweetcaster
I love it
I switched from plume to this because plume was acting up all the time love because it plays videos with out leaving the app and it keeps timeline in order unlike twitter app
"What can I say
"I've been using this app for years and while it's a great app still
Cool app. Easy to use.  Easy setup.
Schedule tweets in multiple accounts - awesome.
"Used 2 be worth using - now
Good 2 go
I like the background sync and realtime notification.  Which is better than others...
"A boot screen that seems to never disappear
"Repeated failures to launch. Sometimes 'Wait' works. Recently takes 3
Until now tweetcaster is the best for androud program
This was a great app compared to others. I have been using for 2 years now and it has the same stupid GUI. Haven't you heard devs that there's a material design out there? It will not affect the performance of your app. Others are implementing the new concept without any trouble. I paid good money on a twitter client while the official is FREE but I chose to get this one because I believed in you. You disappoint me greatly. Uninstalling and good bye until you update your ice age GUI.
Really slow for months now. Flaky and latest thing to fail is the save picture function. The inbuilt browser is an absolute pain as well. It's just a clunky assemblage of bloatware.
Great app. It xoes what I want ot to do.
Damned good
Need to be more flexible
"Keep accumlating old message without purge
Its not working on my galaxy s 2
It jumps to top of timeline i have note 3
Best twitter app on the market. Highly recommended.
Best Twitter app out there.
The best Twitter app I have ever used.
"What's up with the ""load more""  function? It loads a lot less tweets than it used to before it stops. (using load from bottom option). Will email dev."
Nice one
"Used to be slow and laggy to the point where I couldn't use it
This Twitter app is good and having paid i have not seen ads from the apps itselt only Twitter which i can't  blame the app for. That said there are feature that are great while some leave one desperatly wating. With limited space you should see all you can get from the screen prints the App shows.
The dog's nuts of twitter apps!
"After recent updates: *slow*. Can't post pics. TL takes 30sec+ to load. Notifications unreliable (as usual). Can hang at splash screen. Often (valid) image links in tweets will not load. Inbuilt browser is useless
This app is decreasing lately !! .. the original Twitter app is waaaaaaaaaay better !!!
"I love the Zip It feature
"Used to be faultless
Crashes constantly...I've also noticed it's using huge amount of data...need to find a new twitter app
Had uber before and was a😢 nightmare but this so far so good 👍👍
"Lists
"I had this app a few years ago and it was great. Downloaded it yesterday and got charged twice
"Pics will not attach to any tweets/replies/RTs now since the last update. Only works if I ""share"" a pic directly from the gallery. :("
"The last version have many problems. It crashs often and run very slowly. Indeed
Helps make my Note 3 useful
Constant force close. The app I paid for won't even open. please fix asap
Very laggy and almost useless since last update
"Lightweight
Just went pro. I love it...a few days later...Pro crashed after the last update. I AM SO DISAPPOINTED. 😞   This app is unusable. 1 star until it's fixed.
"Maybe I'm just comfortable with it
"Personally
"I'm running a Nexus 4 with Lollipop and the app does nothing but keep freezing and crashing. With pop-up messages asking to stop app and report issue
"This app could be five stars
Love it!
What happened to twitlonger support?
"I've used some others twitter app before. For the last one year
"This is now vary laggy to where I can hardly use it. :(  we need an option to revert
TweetCaster is fast reliable and user friendly
TweetCaster Pro has everything you need most of the other apps  do not have a delete button if you want to delete a tweet  and don't have the proper Rte retweet too...  this is so smooth and you can custom design it... I love it! The only way to use Twitter!!
very good
I love it!
"a lot of people seem to be complaining about crashes.... i was having the same problem
"I've tried all of the Android twitter apps there are. At least on my Galaxy S2
Constant freezing and crashing. Doesn't ever want to load tweets or pictures.
l love this App!
"No complaints whatsoever. Anyone who say it
Since last update it's very slow and laggy like I didn't update it. I've had the pro version since 2010. Fix and I'll give 5 stars again
Great product easy to navigate and handles multiple accounts with ease.
"Do not pay for this. App has started to freeze all the time
Love it. Still the best twitter app in my opinion
Are you thinking about sorting out the search facility and the force closes any time soon? It's been like this for months.
Very smooth. Very fast . Works well on Galaxy S3 and Note 4. Thank you.
"Constantly crashing
Best Twitter application.
"This app has the potential to be the best twitter client on the market. However the developers clearly prefer to add features which contributes to the bloating of the app which in turn contributes to the app being slow and unusable which is what this app has become. The time line won't load
"Since the last update this is very slow to open and load pages. Painfully slow. Please fix
This was my go-to app for Twitter for years and the most recent update has made it so slow as to be almost unusable. I've recommended this app for ages...I'm struggling now to justify its use.
I used to love this app but it's been really slow lately. Please fix this
Another new problem is the loading time when I pressed load more. Why is it loading so late? Like I can't even bother waiting anymore -.-
Works well and hasn't crashed yet. One con is that conversation view isn't accessible with one click.
Cool users interface and relatively simple to use. Love the tweet longer extention but the search options is virtually useless.
The last updates ruined a smooth running app. Now it needs up to 5 minutes to load the timeline. Single accounts can't be loaded. Bookmarks don't work anymore. Sometimes the screen becomes black for no reason. BOOOOOH!!
Crashes at times though!
Love the wishers!
"Refund in 5 minutes. Too slow
"The latest version of Tweetcaster (8.9.7 as of this review) is easily the worst update it has ever had. Aviary
"Stalls whenever I attempt to add a user to a list
When I try to open this app lately most times it will just stay on the blue app title page. When I touch the screen the tweet options menu pops up over the blue screen. Very annoying. Love app when its working. Will be 5stars when fixed.
"Love this all
The best Twitter app out hands down
"A lot of bugs. Since the last update
"Lists
I've been using this for ages and I've never had a problem with it until now. I can't figure out how to send pics via direct message. Help please. Also my tweets are failing today. This has never happened before and nothing I have tried has helped
"I have to keep uninstalling it to get it to work right.  It's VERY slow and crashes often.  Would be a great app
Must have app!!!
تطبيق ممتااااز للتويتر
Search is entirely too slow now following the latest update
I love the retweet with comment function and the list function.  This app is a permanent part of my phone.
Easy to use software.
"sae
"But now
Does what it's supposed to do and I love the dark background.
Love the fact that I don't have to see the advertising. Doesn't crash on my Galaxy Edge
"As of now
"The zipper idea is great
It's a great Twitter app. Gives you everything in a simple and straightforward manner. I highly recommend it.
Awsome app
No better Android client.
Good
tweet so easily
"It takes a little getting use to
Take a while to get to the tweet section but other than that I love love this app
Got all 5 stars as it is relatively the best app out there. I'm saying so after using tons of others. Paid version is simply awesome
Works fine looking at tweets but crashes every time looking at profiles on my Nexus 7. Fix soon or going back to official twitter app.
Love it
"I'd give it zero stars if possible. Every time they do an update
Really f*****g good
"Excellent for both device
"Has to be the best Twitter app
Still awesome even i have change my phone from oppo find way to xiaomi redmi note
#YuRP
This app ROCKS! No UB thin problems with it since purchase a year ago.  Galaxy Note 3.
I like this! But I just wish you had the option to have all twitter accounts on one timeline
So much better interaction with twitter.  Wish I had known about this a while ago.
No Twitter. Don't waste your cash
Love it.
oh well just fine.
Great app not quite a 5 but very close
Seriously the worst memory leak of any app I have EVER USED. Ruins what is otherwise a great app. I have to force close every 5 minutes otherwise images won't display. Clearing image cache does nothing. So annoying :(
Been a little slow lately.
Good
After last update some links not opened well.
Great! I love this app so much
Will back give 5 star if you could consider to give option to hide thumbnails at bottom of full image view in image gallery.
"Needs a REAL auto-complete of Twitter handles. I don't remember the little specifics of names
Perfect replacement for Twitter. Notifications can be easily controlled unlike the official app and zip it is a great feature! :)
Excellent!!!
best
"Relatively easy to follow
Great App. Helps us novice tweeters look like we know what we are doing
My recommendation is instead updating uninstall & install the program fresh.
Does lots of handy extra things.
I like the interface and timeline display.
Does all most everything I need
"This would really have a 5 star if the picture links worked for this app. I've been with this app for months but I'm going to have to uninstall and leave if the pic links don't start working. Keeps shutting off saying ""tweetcaster has stopped working"""
Better than the normal app.  Pay the money for pro app
Great apps madafaka!!
Probably the best twitter client in the market
Needs a UI update to fit with lollipop
Great wee app
Love every aspect of this app. Keep on making those strategic partnerships that add to this app.
Have used a bunch of apps but keep coming back home to   tweet caster.
cut sync off instead of 2 hr max.
"Gallery view please. Otherwise
"The colors are fixed
"Love this app..so many features and clean interface..my only hate is the readability link
"Functional
"Great app
"The new look
"no flaws
"If we could see who favoured our tweets this would be a 5
"Great app
"Since last update
"To see “who retweeted this“ I need to go to more details.  The older design was more simple and easy to access “who retweeted this"".  Also an extra step is needed to copy the tweet!!   Really accessibility to features becomes harder."
Please fix the painfully bright colors for the tweets and mentions.
"After using this for almost 4 years
"Excellent interface
Great app
Ive been using it since i first met it a couple a years ago and i dont have any plans to change it.
It's the bomb!
"This used to be a really great app but for several months it's had a memory leak issue that hasn't been fixed in any of the updates. After running for a while
The title should say it all. The many features are a welcomed bonus. The added theme options also a welcomed perk. With the combination of all that makes this app very hard to beat.
Very good app
Finally fixed the bugs back to buisness best twitter app around and ive tried them all could use some help in the design department but other than that this app is solid
Perfect app but If you put (translating tweets) I will rate it 5 stars.
Awesome
I've used tweetcaster exclusively but it's been draining my battery even with all notification turned off.
"Samsung 5
Set to ping me on most important Tweets and DMs
More reliable than the Twitter app!
I like it
Still my favorite app for twitter
The pro version is better because of the lack of advertisements. The features are nice and I can see conversations unlike seesmic.
The best Twitter app
Really like how they keep improving the interface.
Love this app
"Used to be awesome
Finally got larger previews. SWEET! 🙌😍
The title says it all.
"Really like this app (pro)
"it is S L O W!  Even though I paid for the app
Loving the tweetcaster pro.
A few times it stalled I would like to he able to look up a user without from the menu...
This is a great tool for managing twiter especially if you have multiple accounts. I love the control and flexibility it offers and saves me a lot of time.
Easy to use.
Love it! Best Twitter app!
Back button frequently does not work after going into pictures or vine videos. *Gxy Note 3*
I can see only 2 pics and then can't open anymore. Please pleaseee fix them
Best Twitter Application I've Used
"Better even than Twitter's own app! Couldn't be without it.Having spent so long using free version
Much better than twitter
Since last update don't seem to be getting notifications until I open app. Galaxy Note 3
Tweetcaster
Goat
I paid for this app but I always get the Twitter Limit thing and end up NOT being able to use it at all. Now I'm using the generic Twitter app for Android. I want a REFUND!
"OneLouder is one of the top Android developer today.  Everything they touch turned into gold. TweetCaster is one of them.   She is a beauty to look at on the outside.  Inside the app engine
Great for new and old alike... Terrific functionality AND allows themes like a DARK screen... Rejoice!
Wish there was push notifications
Love this app so far! No complaints.  Only gave it 4 stars because I need to test it more.
By far the best Twitter app. Worth every penny. Seriously.
Pictures don't display. I use the pro app everyday. Many times linked pictures dont display. AT ALL. A basic feature!!! When I try to look at a picture this app crashes. Guys... Seriously... Fix this issue! Captain packrat is correct. Memory leak. Ck out another app.
"Hard to differentiate between video and photos from the preview. There used to be a ""play button"" on video previews
"Would love to give it 5 star but it's not perfect. It won't keep my CAPITALISED saved words and TLAs.  Also
I had some trouble getting app to work and emailed OneLouder. They responded quickly and turned out the problem was me and not the app. I love this app and appreciate OneLouder's quick response.
"The new media view just sux
The official Twitter app dragged down my system. This app gets me back online!
This is hands down with no competition the BEST Twitter application!
Love it
This is my favorite twitter client bay far. Would like emoji.
"I am NEVER notified of any @ or msg. Ever. I even had it set to refresh every 1 minute while I was having a conversation &  still nothing I was even backed out of the app and no notification.  Also can't look through pictures friends have uploaded. Good luck scrolling through there tweets. Let's say you add a new friend
"The widget disappeared
Best client I've used - every update adds something new. UPDATED: Please add Wear support for integration with Android wearables!
"Haven't found another Twitter app that offers the features and customisation options Tweetcaster has. Has all I need and want
"By Far The Best!!! Twitter App....Hands Down
One of the best social apps. ..ever.

"If all you want to do is read tweets

"Twitter is a key part of my work
I love the newest update! The bigger pics are awesome! Keep up the awesome work!
Works well these days. Could use a template system. I save to drafts and copy & paste.
Great app
Much better
Excellent
Good to  get good to have
Doesnt work good with galaxy S4 it forces to close every time.. plz fix it
Much prefer it over the official twitter app. Used it over several phones with no problems.
"I've had tweetcastor from day 1. And I love this app. All the color displays available etc. It's fun. I've tried regular twitter
"If you use Twitter a lot
Good app!
Love it. Use it.
Tweetcaster needs a new profile look! The icon scooted up just a little to overlap the headed like on web would be perfect.
"The Update finally worked!  Thank You!!   I can now sign in!! (I can't use any other app
"If accumulates a lot of data after a while which slows down reaction time
And I have most Twitter apps downloaded but over the years I keep coming back to TweetCaster. Time to unload and uninstall the rest.
"It's Okay
Great app
I hope u refine the app design and some cool effects when opening the Twitter gap and new tweets.
I love this app!
Simply the best!
"Timeline refresh fails too often. Big chunks just disappear
Still finding it hot or miss whether pictures will open or if I get the black screen of doom. On both Galaxy Note tablet & Xperia Z phone. This had been going on for at least a month or two.
Why bookmark only 1 even we add so many?
Best twitter app in the market
"Still my favorite Twitter client. And even though this update made the font a little smaller
Good app but after last update the font on the trends is very small
"I've tried many clients
Love it! Best app hands down
Can't view video uploaded to pic.twitter
"still the best among twitter apps but have a few that needs improving on
I have used tweetcaster with numerous android phone and it is brilliant
Works for me with two different accounts.Give it a go
Loving it ☺
Better than twitter itself
Gets better with each update!!
"Used this app for years
"It tries to do too much. I had previously uninstall it because of bloating. Using it again
I would give this app at least 4 stars if it weren't for readability. Too many bugs. I wish I could go straight to the website. And it's very buggy linking to pictures.
"Search
This is my go to Twitter app on my phone. I use the Pro app and it has been well worth it.
"Cleanest
Good program for twitter but with flaws. Very hard for example to look for a follower or people you follow. This is very basic.
Only 4 stars as soon as you use a draft it disappears out of the draft folder. If I am writing tweets about rugby I need to use the same basic tweet several times.
By far the best twitter app for droid.. (moto blur)
I'm not that into Twitter but this app has made it easy to figure out what I'm doing
Been using Tweetcaster for 4 years. Never disappoints!
I use  pro app everyday but I can't clik hashtag
Great stuff
I've tried lots of Twitter aps but keep coming back to this one!
...
Haven't found a Twitter app that works better!
I have used this for years. I occasionally yet other apps including the official one and always come back to this one.
Still my favorite Twitter client.
Great client always had been
Does everything it needs to.
"I would have given it 5/5
Great for multiple twitter accounts and posting to one or more at once.
It's cool
Much faster after uninstall reinstall
I like this app a lot but sometimes it's buggy
"I've tried many
"I have tried loads of others
"Tweetcaster is my favorite Twitter app. I would give it 5 Stars if I could check as read my DMs. I sometimes use my computer and read them
I've been using Tweetcaster for about two and a half years now. It's a feature rich Twitter client and I've yet to find anything that beats it. Great job developers!
"I find myself being severely disappointed with this app now. I have tweets not showing up in my TL
I have problem & they fix it very fast and follow up with me all the time ...very good service
Great!!
Love TweetCaster! Allows more overall control of Twitter account then other apps. Tons of features built in.
Great features fast and better than the original twitter app
Image uploads are failing.  Not allowing you to post.
Does what it says on the tin. Doesn't always offer me ppl I follow when I start typing @-name which is a bit of a frustration
Works awesome
Love the TweetCaster.
One of the first I go for with a new phone.
I've had it Since Twitter came out m never a problem and easy to use.
Easy and convenient
a great Twitter App... has many features that aren't found elsewhere.  I love it!
Best on Play for multiple Twitter accounts.
"A lot better than the official app in every way
Best twitter app
Hands Down the best social media app available
"Great interface
Can someone help me?its been weeks i couldnt sign in to twitter via tweetcaster..even after update it still stated as failed to connect to twitter...heelllppp
i love it
I love the large print options!  Pity it is so hard to contact devs. Would love to be able to order descending (newest posts at bottom). 5 stars for a positive reply from devs if you read your reviews
Fantastic app. One of my favorites. The best Twitter app out there. Highly Recommend !!!
Best twitter app
Can't retweet-telling me it's automated. Can't RT with mention either.
"What can I say other than the fact that it's great! When you have more to say
Ok
Love it
Me es más amigable que la interfaz oficial
I love this app. It is way better than others I have tried.
Best way to use twitter. Love all the ways you can customize it.
I don't receive notifs anymore after the last update. ):
Lots of performance bugs fixed. But dropping the ball. Still miles behind. Can't view DM images unless previews are on without it opening your web browser or another twitter based app. Still no gif support without opening browser/other twitter app. Refresh limits can still grate your nerves as the auto refresh is semi-reliable at best. App is still prone to start up crashes every now and then. App easily could score 4/5 or even 5/5 if DM images and gif support make the next patch.
What happened to the people search?
The Best!!!!!
Each update makes a different problem. Kinda starting to not be worth this app.
"Fast
"I use this app several times a day. I searched for a great Twitter client
Love it!
"This app has a very very good UI and tons of features that are handy to and work seamlessly
افضل برامج تويتر بلا منازع
Still the best Twitter app..
Very easy to use and so much better than the original Twitter client. More features too.
Much better than older versions or the native twitter app!
It does everything I have ever asked for from a twitter client
I am a fan. I love it.
Would be better if they didn't try to make it look like IOS7 (flat buttons etc)
"Regular updates. Clean
"After the last update
"Probably the best Twitter app out there. Only thing missing here is push notifications
"Great app with loads of features
Love it...nothing bad at all so far. The best Twitter app by far.
It allows me to post more than 140 characters thanks to Tweetlonger!
I don't know if it's got anything to do with twitters API rules but it's getting very frustrating seeing the exact same retweet on your timeline over and over and if it's popular accounts who you and your friends follow you see the same tweet again and again. And the UI needs a massive overhaul now it's getting a tad boring. I love tweetcaster but I've been using it a lot less as of late.
Love it
I dig it.
Excellent Thanks
User friendly and it has a good customizable colours.
"Superb app
"Maximizes Twitter on Android. Latest update is solid
Or update. I've uninstalled and re-installed twice today. Plase fix. I've got a Galaxy Note 2
Doing well!
Not really into Twitter but is really good app works fine with all the new updates
"Best paid app I own. Very good and very quick on load speeds. I recommend that you buy this app. It's 100% without a doubt worth the money
It's easy and clean
Best app for twitter
In lov  with tweetcaster
"bought the pro version
Last update has killed it. Sort it out devs.
I send two tweets and I get a msg stating I'm over Twitters limit for tweeting. Then I can't do anything for 10 min. Uninstall
I used to love it but now I hate the delay to tweet almost seems like it freezes. I hate waiting to reply to someone tweets. Seriously has me looking at others now. Still want to give it a chance but delay in tweeting is not good
I just bought it and I'm in love this apps so much
Th best Twitter app PERIOD.
"Every time an update happens
Of late it's missing tweets from my time line - a basic function. Time to find another app. Sigh. Can't people stop 'improving' things that work?

"Whatever you did
"I love that it returns to where you were before in the feed. Missing only built-in vine player. Edit - now plays vines in-app - what's next
"I loved Tweetcaster on iOS. I could zip people and never see them unless I wanted to
Keep working out thse kinks and it'll be GREAT!
"Since the update
Great app but for some reason I cannot send attachments in direct messages
No ads
"I've used the free version for over a year and have been impressed with its overall performance and features that I recently upgraded to the Pro version. I couldn't be happier. Each time I've tried other similar apps
When I first got this app it worked great. Now it's very slow and sends my tweets twice.
"Most of the time it's a great app
Can't attach photos to DMs and notifications are seriously slow. Don't waste your $$ on the pro version.
"It looks good
Fantastic a+++
I live this app but recently when I try to tweet or retweet with comment my phone goes to sleep before the tweet screen ever appears. I'm not sure what's causing the lag but it needs to be fixed asap.
"This app is more than a ""prettifier"" for Twitter. It allows you to assign different colors to those tweets that matter most to you. It also borrows from Twitter its ability to make ""lists"" (think: groups) to sort your the tweet stream
"I've used this Twitter client for about 3 years with no problems so I bought it
Bought the app. It constantly freezes. Works slow and choppy.
"You expect this from a free version
"If you have a set of tweeters you want to keep up with
Far superior to Twitter's own app. Long live TweetCaster!
now that @onelouder is not.  supports Slices.  I use this app daily and gets better with Pro
I like it It needs just a bit more improvement
The app needs an update where you can use the actual Pocket app to read articles later instead of having to sign in online.
"In 2011 I gave 5 stars coz it was better than other apps 
I have 3 Twitter accounts. TweetCaster Pro permits me to edit  and submit tweets for 2 or 3 accounts at the same time. I can manage Twitter very easily on a smartphone and tablet.
Best social media ever
"Could have a cleaner interface
Yup
Used to be good but every time I try to add the widget it crashes. Try reinstalling but made no difference. Pls fix!
Way better than twitter app!
I would suggest this to everyone
Been using for a long time. Always happy with it. Updates always excite. Recommend Pro for sure. Currently using Samsung Galaxy S5.
Been using tweetcaster for a minute and I expect nothing but the best every time. Sometimes it acts up but customer service responds quickly so I have no issues.
Great app!
I haven't found anything that can compare.
update makes DMs hard to manage. Needs way to mark all as read. also ability to DM pictures would be nice.
Tried another apps but prefer this one
I love the app but I don't see anything different from the free app.
It seems to-be very very.Its easy to Use..Awesome Stuff. Thanks tweetcaster.
new update wont even let me go past the authentication page.
Very functional app
"Best twitter app so far 
This is the best twitter app that i've ever used..
Went pro after two years of using the free version. Solid client. I do wish it showed when people favorite or retweet my tweets (unless that's an option that I just haven't found yet).
The button @ should be all  interactions not only mentions ....
Loving the updates
A++++
It is the best app. But it crashe after the new Android update 4.2.2. Thank you it is perfect five star
Hide RT option and gif pics are not working.
Lack of G+ & push notifications makes this pretty much useless for me.
Super
Generally doesn't have a ui that sucks which is pretty much a miracle from twitter apps. If only you could reverse the timeline
"I loved TweetCaster so I bought the pro version. Happy years went by. All of the sudden
I've tried all the twitter apps and this is by far the best!
"Great Flow
It just works!
GOOD
"Great apps
Good stuff.
Couldn't be better.
Awesome and keeps getting better!
"Include an option to delete old tweets from the timeline. The reason the app runs so slow is because if you're following a lot of people you have 5000+ tweets on your TL and the app then goes at a snails pace. I usually just ""clear data"" the app but every time I do I lose all my settings."
Is app compatible with Android Wear?
Since the most recent update when I log out the app automatically logs me back in after a few minutes.  Usually love this app but this is annoying.  Please fix
I love using this Twitter app. Thanks for keeping it up to date and releasing speedy fixes.
This app beats every other app. Hands Down.
Love this app because it allows me to add more content.  Sometimes I hsve issues with adding content to a tweet but nothing else comes close to this so I'm a user forever! This is a great app for posting longer tweets! It's sometimes buggy or slow but still the best one available.
I may have missed a setting somewhere but the new lines to separate tweets just looks plain ugly. Please remove or give us the option to not show the horizontal lines!
"Notifications for new tweets should not be set by default. Phone vibrated incessantly after install
Excelent
On the detailed forum it says there's 12 themes...I only have 2 Light and Dark......please me help me understand
Too many permissions asked
Perfect
really nice app very stylish a  keeper its fantastic love it  :-)
This app has become very slow over last few weeks. Takes almost a minute to upload earlier tweets & 20 secs to refresh timeline. Recommend you look for alternate app till fixed.
Color scheme sucks with the updates though
Best twitter client ... After gravity for symbian I love this for android too good
Really easy to use. Nearby function is great too.
"Now that I switched phones
The best.
Ok twitter app but not intuitive nor user friendly.
Sync works well between Note 3 and Galaxy Tab S once I finally figured out how Tweetmarker works within the app.
Note 3
My favorite twitter app
I will give you 5 star if you fix the limit. Its keep limit when im try refresh my timeline
Useless app.
I'm still learning how to use it properly but it's a flexible good looking app
When it comes to Twitter...this app if the dog's balls!
"Very slow and lags. Was fine
I love using tweetcaster. It's a great app. I can tweet more than 140 characters and it will shorten it and put a link to the entire tweet.
Please update the ui for tablets like you did on the phone ui
"I've used this app for over 2 yrs & have loved it until now. Every time I try to reply to someone the app closes. Also
Like That
Cool
Works very well.
A couple of crashes on my new LG G3. Fix that for the 5th star... 😀
Would be good if themes and tweet options were brought into 2014...new redesign is better but feels old school and clunky still.
"This app offers the best twitter experience
Probably the best for Android
Easy to use
Best Twitter app on google play
Great way to get up to the date news from non network sources.
I love this app so much the way you do it is awesome I am now a samsung galaxy s4 user so I luv your app even more thank you
Just love this app...
Superb app
Great
Best twitter client around. Tried Plume and Echofon. Didnt't like em. The most complete and feature packed twitter apps in the market.
I like this app to manage twitter
So much delay when one tries to tweet or retweet. It's like it goes blank for some time till one can write something. Yhoooo. WTF?? Attend to dis lag abeg...
"The delay in tweeting is my only issue. Other clients go instantly
Great app for Twitter.
"Love the new update
Seriously... it rate limit my twitter even before i start to scroll the tweets! its like once i launch it told me its rate limit.... do smth bout it and i'll give a 5 stars! Cheer mate
For twitter
I can't post tweets. Each time I tap the icon I get a black screen & then the app crashes
Muy buena app
Working fine but had bugs earlier
"nice app but if you can make the apperance of time line smooth 
The app is great and I have used it for 3 years with little issue. The only flaw is the Readability browser is terrible so I've switched it off.
I like this twitter client.  The only gripe I have is that it doesn't have a mute function.  It has the zip feature but that's ugly.  :)
"Web browser can be a little painful at times and some pic wont display
App doesn't load 90% of the time and is very unresponsive!
"This is the best APP for twitter
"Tried loads
Love it give u many option better than the original
"I have temporarily went back to twitter app to post tweets as since the new update it takes 5 seconds or more for the new tweet screen to open.  I have a Samsung s5
Totally love this app. Great menu. East to navigate. Worth paying for.
I Iike it
Still has trouble with timeline position from last read.
"I've been a user of TweetCaster Pro for a number of years now and it's still pretty much the best Twitter client out there. All that is missing is the 'Mute' feature recently added to the Twitter website. OneApp
Nice application
Worthed apps
Was the best twitter app available.  New UI is a big step backwards. Looks like a v1 app rather than a mature product.  Rolling back to older version.
The app that I once would've described as the best for twitter is now the worst. Crashes every five minutes please fix
I can't sign in.
"Problem before the update
Def worth getting if use twitter a lot
Can you guys make this work on Android L
"I'm very happy with Tweetcaster Pro
I love the custom font size option but I have a problem. The screen used to post a new tweet it takes about 4 seconds to load. My device is a Samsung Galaxy S3.
Love This App
"This is my favorite Twitter application
I've tried them all but Tweetcaster Pro is my favourite app.
My primary twitter client. But Facebook connection lost sometime.
I bought this app 2 years ago. Loved it. But now I go to sign in yesterday and I can't! You say I dont have a token? Realllly?!  Wth?
Pay
The most wonderful thing is that it shows 2 avatars on any Retweet. The design is nice but needs to have sharper lines and it is not quite high dev. So work on that plz
"Still enjoying this versatile Twitter app and the update to the interface is icing on the cake. The full screen loading splash is not the best
This is by far the best twitter app I've used. I recommend it to all my friends and family. Keep up the great work.
"I once tried the free one and satisfied with it. Thus
CAN'T SHARE TWEETS TO FACEBOOK
"Someone that made your life wonderful....until one day they just don't. Crashes
So much packed into this App. Best Twitter client by a long way.
Way better than the twitter app. Only 1 problem.  I wish i could view who favorited my tweet without using my browser like the older versions did. That'll get it 5 stars :)
Everytime I click on to trend topics it error message come up and said rate limit has been exceed..and it be my 1st checking it...please fix!!!!
I use twitter for news and have exactly three subscriptions. Great options to allow me to get those tweets in a neat and timely fashion.
"After update alway hank
Don't use that much but every time I try to use it more or less tells me to Come back later.....???? And its the paid version. Doesn't stay updated. Very glitchy.???????
Does everything it says
Makes twitter rock that much more! Awesome app!!!
Excellent Application
Much better Then Tweetdeck a Nice Twitter client :-)
Enough said....
The new look is amazing and i love the rounded avatars. Its a great app but I wish I could edit the color of the mentions and my tweets in the bubble themes..
Use this app everyday. Twitter and Facebook posting made so simple. Thanks for a great app. Worth the price for the Pro version. No ads
So many problems I'm not going to bother listing them
"Love this update
"Being a pro user
The update makes this app run so much smoother only thing I wish can be added is jump to the top button when you're in your list instead of having to hit the option button to jump to the top
"Absolutely fantastic until the latest update
"The best Twitter app by a country mile
Much better
Now a days I am on TweetCaster for catching up with what is happening when and where because I am following many news postings
Keeps lagging/freezing when trying to refresh or scroll. Please fix.
Constantly crashing. Tweets not posting. I see I'm not alone. Have sent report after report but One Louder don't seem to care. Has made my phone shut down at least 3 times today. Has crashed 4 times in 3 minutes this evening. Do not buy this app.
"Please give me back my money. You're slowing down
I do like some of the features of this app like tweeting from 2 accounts at same time. Also love that can get preview of Instagram pics. However the reason I am uninstalling is the fact you cannot be notified when you have new followers or requests from ppl to follow. Also no notifications for ppl favouriting tweets. If these features are added I will return
I would give it 5 stars if the gallery option worked  the rest of the app is good
"Love this app. Everything I'm looking for in a Twitter app like intuitive and clever searching. Fast posting and feed viewing via the fantastic widgets. Easy to use especially across multiple Twitter accounts. Zip and unzip
Better
Does what u want u can mute people tweet longer search nearby
"push Notifications are either always a few minutes late or I don't get notified at all.   as for the date issues
"Fast
Works great.
I love Tweetcaster!
"After having issues for months
Power users will like TweetCaster until you realize how slow & bloated the app is/becomes. It moves especially slow transitioning between screens or the initial open. Says it is 5 mb on store but shows at 18+ mb in my phone. In need of a major UI update cause it's fugly!
Still the best. Love the FB cross post feature.
I can't open twitpic though. So please fix it. Overall I like the app! Thanks!
Fantastic app! So much better than the official one. Navigation is great!
"Stable
Makes my twitter life a breeze.
Too much foreclosure. It also double post.
"Ich war hier lange auf der Suche nach einem schicken Client
I find it excellent. Thank you
"Used to love this app
Сыро очень
"Slow
It will be good if there's PC Version of this app! Keep up the good work!
"The UI needs a fresh overhaul... needs separate feeds for photos
it should view multiple twitter picture too
I prefer the widget over the others I've tried. The app is generally stable and responsive.
Good product. Wish it would let tweets go to facebook fan page not personal.
Hands down the best mobile twitter app I've ever used.  Must have for any twitter user especially those with multiple accounts.
It's a bit like TweetDeck used to be. Ace.
best
"Very good
Title says it all. Very much worth the money for the pro version.
This is a great app and I use it daily as my main twitter client.... It has some excellent features and is so simple to use. I would highly recommend it.
It just work.
nice app no complains now.
"Very easy to use functionally
Great app easy to use
the interface is ugly and has not been updated for years. bring us a android design complianced version!
Worth it
Great app.
Revolutionary
Love it
I •LOVE• this app!  It is so functional with all of it's KEWL features!!!
Still unable to view Twitpic  photos on the TL.. Other than that I'd give 5 stars with no hesitation.
"The best twitter app I have found
Better than the official Twitter app.... The app is starting to take a while sending tweets. I have no patience. 😐
"Every time try to open an preview or profile image
"Good to update and tweet to others
This is my favorite tweet app on my mobile.  I have been using it exclusively since joining Twitter. Love the retweet with comment option.
"Smooth
It lifts! GS4
Takes care of all my Twitter accounts beautifully. Easy to keep up with all phases of my personality!!!
The app needs to be redo signed its slow and laggy.
Sadly very buggy in my second HTC One.  Multiple installs.
"Is it too much to ask for the notifications to work?! It is
"New clients show up others don't get updates. Yet
Decent app please fix the rate limit pop up it's so freaky annoying
Wish I could  rate it higher. But the current version is still broken and I have to reload earlier versions to use it.
wld hv given it another star if it  had in line browsing
This app is so much better than the regular Twitter app.
"Far better than Twitter app
It's the best twitter client but it only lacks classy colors themes
Would like to see larger picture preview otherwise a pretty good app.
Nice and user friendly twitter app
I personally prefer this to basic Twitter. Just like the look and find it clearer and easier to search and use. No problems with crashing ... Yet!!
I've using this and I like it. It's a door to a lame one way talking twitter
I like to use this app
Great app! But would be better if we could get notifications for new followers and who retweets our tweets. Samsung Galaxy S4  @msdiva404
Program was messing up a lot so I uninstalled it.After a few days put it back on the phone and once again it would post on Twitter. It really is my fave Twitter program
"What used to be a hot app is now clunky
Okay
Great app. Everything I want is right here. Kudos to One Louder.
"TweetCaster is currently the best Twitter app available on Android that has a good implementation of Lists.   I use Lists to follow along to different subjects
I would rate the app higher if it wasn't always force quitting on me for no reason besides that the app works perfectly fine//I rated it 5 stars this time cause after some updates this app has got much better

برنامج جميل بمعنى الكلمة
The best twitter app available. Use it non stop and will keep with it. Does everything I need perfectly.
Woke up today to find TweetCaster Pro refuses ('fails') to send every other tweet and/or RT. Not impressed at all. The app worked fine before this - how do I get the previous install back?!
Great app
I have a Note 3 and it keeps pausing after awhile of using it.
Best twitter app I ever used
Super slow. Uninstall and reinstall muuuuuch better. Back to #1
Coming from tweet deck on ios this app is not bad but not as smooth as tweet deck. Hate how links don't open  automatically but I guess that's not really a big deal.
Loads of great features and it's usability over the traditional twitter apk is just unbelievable.  I could never go back to the original after trying this.
I  just want a better navigation set up. Having to reach to the top left with one handed operation is difficult and same with other options like trends.. The need to be on the side bar or bottom of display.
Great app for twitter.  Use the pro version so that all my accounts can be used.
Great App! As a artist who likes to stay connected I love the features.
"My timeline position is not saved across devices
Cant even scroll through my timeline. This application has become horrible with recent updates. Very laggy and now a complete waste of time
Great app Great app #FAM @mik3Rivera @sharks4life408 Robstah_408 Great Great app!!!!
Best Twitter app I've found for multiple accounts and no adds. BUT hung on composing tweets after I tried one with 2 photos. Had to completely reinstall and not try that again.
Love it! A lot of features to work with and very efficient....
Love this app but I have only 1 problem with it....u cannot look through other ppls pics like the original twitter app...other than that 5/5
The same error is still from 2011 about rate but now is fixed
I love being able to have multiple accounts under one app.
"very useful tool
"I had 2 bring it down a star because the notifications have been going off like crazy when I click on links & go thru my custom follower lists. Am I the only 1 whose experiencing this problem?! Other than that
No option to set default browser or YouTube. Unintuitive.
"Would be more useful if they actually opened the tweet for which they notify. Otherwise
"I had enjoyed the free version so much that I opted to buy the pro version. Worked incredibly well
"Very rich in features with the exception of push notifications (those would be highly appreciated!) And I'd also appreciate more chances for personalization visually. However
awesome
"Extremely slow when it opens and then it doesn't respond. I used to recommend this app to anyone that asked. The recent updates haven't fixed any of the ""bugs"" I'm experiencing and I have lost my patience. Now I'm looking for a new app and will probably find one better for free because it doesn't take much. Congrats
"The only real disadvantages are the unavailability to see user's Twitter page view
Constantly force closes!!  Impossible to reply to tweets!!  Used to be a great app... what happened??
htc one m8
Hence Uninstalled
The whole app is very good but this version is slow and rubbish and always screen stops and lag..fix it quickly
What are you doing dev? It's sluggish and the app seems to drain memory more. Try harder!
"Now broken on my Nexus 7. App keeps crashing. Such a shame
"Even the paid-for version uses pop-up adverts. ""Post later"" feature is poorly-designed. UI is a bit crappy. Often shows tweets multiple times. Stick with the free version - this one's flaky.  ""New tweet"" crashes every time now. I'd love to know what OneLouder has done."
Would give it five stars if the performance was better. I have to uninstall then reinstall the app multiple times throughout the month because the tweeting process (composing a tweet) lags terribly. I also am experiencing a slower Timeline (this just began.)  not sure what happened.

The best over all !! Even better than Tweetbot for iPhone !!!

"I love this app
"Last 2 ""updates"" have rendered this app useless. Tweets don't send
"This app was amazing when I first got it. Now
The only twitter app I use
Tweetcaster I think is great app to use if ur new to twitter straight forward UI layout...
App was excellent until the last update. Now the widget is no longer re-sizeable and notifications are fully expanded. Please fix it
"I wish I could disable the splash screen
Better than Twitter's own app
"I previously gave TweetCaster a 5* review but have pulled it down to 3 due to the incessant buzzing if I take more than 10 seconds to view a picture
Issues where fired fixed! Now works great!
Opening a new tweet is starting to become a project by the time you want to tweet something and the new tweet window opens you forget what you want to send out it's that slow
Still broken & badly lagging after April 3rd update.     Latest update has made  it lag so badly after viewing an image & then returning to timeline.  Also now takes ages just to open up.
Easily the best twitter app out there. Been using it for years!
Easy to use and a great app
"All versions released from March 19 to April 1 crashed on start for me. Update from April 2 seems to have resolved issue. However
Was five stars before last update. That killed the apps ability to remember its place in my timeline. Even with the outside service engaged it doesn't work.
All my tweets are zipped and app just crashes.  Release management 101.
"Excellent app

Love love love !!
Love this app.  It is so much better than the regular twitter app.
"Great app
Lags. UI is in need of an update. I've been using Tweetings as my go to cause it moves much faster and looks better with all the same features
I love this app.
"Since I last installed the app it has new modifications that I like 
I like it.
Been using for a long time n this is the first time TC dissapoint me. It keeps delaying my tweet. N it is still failed even though im using wifi

The nuts
Every time I try to post a photo I get a failed to upload photo msg. How's about fixing this as I did pay for this ap.
Continually freezes and takes forever to run. Used to be a great app.
"This is the best app that I used for Twitter
Unable to post tweets to Facebook. Can't see people in interactions. What's this fav star!? Why so complicated!!! This used to work beautifully.
"With the new update I receive notifications in my menu bar when I tweet
This is by far better than any twitter app I have ever had. 2 thumbs up
Easy & good to use. Many issues after updating & widget won't refresh. Wish there were more themes & nicer UI
I did. But it's gotten worse with every update. Slow. Have to try to post tweets multiple times before they would post. Not really multiple account friendly anymore in that regard either. Disappointing. And allowing us to make our own themes/wallpapers would be nice. Notifications don't work either. Needs a lot of work. Fix it and I'll reinstall it.
Love this app. Use it everyday. The only thing I dislike is u dont get a notification when someone follows you or doesn't show up whos followed u under @!
Very good app
Best of the best!
After using for 30 minutes or so I uninstalled my standard Twitter app. This is better. On phone or tablet.
Muito bom
Superb app great features and support
"This app makes Twitter so much more enjoyable
Most useful Twitter app I've ever used. Wish I could just click on tweets to see conversation instead of a menu but this is a small gripe against an otherwise excellent product
SGS3
Dynamic and flexible
"Everything works great
So many updates screw it up.
Tried lots... Keep coming back
Great app
Very Cool
Must have twitter app!
I have upgraded from S2 to S4 & have found I love Tweetcaster even more on a better phone. Seriously my most-used app. ☆☆☆☆☆
The best twitter app I've used.

Great app. It keeps getting better every major update. I use the Pro app. Best $4.99 I've spent. Being able to schedule tweets is my favorite feature and NO ADS is a major boost!
When I want to write a tweet it takes about 10/15 seconds for the screen to appear. Could be my phone (s4 mini)? Idk but it's interfering with my need for speed tweeting. Wasn't always like this.
"Tweetcaster is my preferred twitter app
No better Twitter app around.

Great and useful
Superb Twitter client
"Why not give the option immediately upon clicking on a feed link to open in a different browser rather than take us to pathetic tweetcaster  browser and THEN making us open in a different browser?  Maybe make this a ""pro"" feature? Your browser is a waste of time and honestly seems like an afterthought on onelouder's part. 5 stars when you fix the browser or let me open links in my browser of choice immediately upon clicking.Main gripe about the browser is its slowness. Go for speed like chrome or dolphin."
I have used this app on two different devices and worked great on both. HTC Evo and Nexus 5. I haven't had problems of any kind


"Minus Twitpics

Don't look further
Won't upload pics...
"Stopped using it for awhile now
"Been having issues for months with opening tweetlongers. I emailed the company and they worked diligently
Best twitter client.

Absolutely love it
The best!!
Good functionality and UI
"After SEVERAL updates and three years using this app there has STILL been no change in this app. Still freezes
Very smart and friendly used.
"Only bad thing is you can't just one-click to see a link or check out an account's profile that is inside a tweet. Other than that

"the time line is  jumping alot
Perfect Twitter App... Without a doubt!
Great

Tried all the other apps but invariably returned to this.
It is funny and better than classic one
"Simply
love this app! great on kitkat! Matt m6ceb
This used to be my favourite Twitter client. Unfortunately I'm now finding that's it's really suffering from very serious lagging! I'm using a HTC One so it's not lack of processing power!
"The app works really well and has a ton of features
"Used to love this app
"Amazing on my tablet
The best and most aesthetically pleasing Twitter app on the market. Ability to turn off retweets of users in app. Worth the $$$.

Very nice app.
Great way to communicate with people you know and meet people you don't know
Love it.
I love this app. I would recommend it to anyone :D
Best Twitter App Hands down!!
This app has gotten verrrry heavy and although I understand the need to expand and have more and more features its also become quite laggy in its old age especially when dealling with multiple accounts
Great Twitter app.
Provides customization not available in the official Twitter app.

Best twitter app for Android !!
"The most complete and crash proof from all twitter apps that I have used. The UI can be better. For example the in-line picture can be bigger
Great app.
"Just updated to version 8.3. It seems that in this version
Fixed timeline position so back to 5 star
"I love this app but recently it's been crashing and takes forever to open and send messages. Almost all of the time it says I can wait or close program but then it never works if you wait. Please fix this bug
I love how easily you can navigate the app & it is so simple to use!
This WAS my favorite multi platform app. No longer posts to Facebook.  Every update gets worse.  Think it's time to move on...

Keeps getting better and better
"It'd be nice if it was smart enough to queue tweets to send when data is available
What twitter should be.
My favorite twitter app.
"Ever since the 8.2 update the screen blanks repeatedly out on my Samsung galaxy tab
"One of the reasons with which I was able to convince myself to pay for this was because of the promised push notifications. I don't see any. I'm willing to revise my rating if they fix that in the next update. For the meantime
"When going to the timeline avatar picture show up
This IS the best twitter/Facebook app around and has been for many years. It's affordable and I MUST have it on any phone I have.
I am running android 4.4 on a nexus 7 2nd generation. Since the last update the screen goes blank often. I paid for this app so fix it! Update: 8.2 update still hasn't fixed the issue.
Working great for me. This apps is great.
"Becomes irresponsive regularly. New Tweets counter sometimes appears post factum
"Much
easy and simple for everyday.
Themes have improved my tweeting experience. Multiple accounts are handled well. Solid and reliable.
"Man
"Even if you UNCHECK the Follow OneLouder box
Best Twitter app i found by far follow me if ya feel like it
"Great app
Great App with a lot of useful features
Keeps force closing
Love it.  It's addicting.  More features than access through the web.  Enough said.
I never tweeted until I started using the app !
Now it seems like the dev has forgotten about the big percentage of gingerbread users. Purchased the full version to have the app force close every time I want to tweet using the widget and the horribly long delay in opening the app. Used to be a once great app for Twitter but now more time is spent waiting for force close
This issue came after last update its auto exit .l am on miui rom Htc one
Doesn't show tweets / timeline unless you scroll. Doesn't return to top of timeline unless you manually scroll all the way up. Slow to respond. Not good at all now!
"This is a fantastic app

It had been doing well for such a long time and then it started to lag. Now it opens up and all you see is the bird and no timeline. I hope they resolve this issue soon.
"Keeps getting better
Easy to use
"My favorite Twitter app. Interface isn't ideal on my phone but
"Perfect twitter app. If not for twitters limitation
"Plays instagram and vine videos

Lots of useful functions.
not impressed
Excellent app. Works better than any other Twitter app and great support.

Just installed on new phone. Direct Messages will not clear after initial tutorial. It still has the total count listed. Please fix! I've always wanted G+ integration. Please make it happen!
"Very slow
"I have been using this app forever
I don't really know how or why but with every update they seem to spoil it. I have paid for it and on the whole I like it but it crashes regularly on both my Moto G and HTC One. I wonder how badly this would perform on an older device. Devs be advised not everyone has that latest quad core 1.5Ghz+ cutting edge device.
It's everything you need plus things you didn't know you needed.
I really like it!! On my phone and tablet. Great app.  Lenovo tablet Moto x phone
"When going to view someone's profile
The pro is better (pink too)updating and upgrading.
Very good App.

"The interface is getting old
"Screen goes blank
"Still sticks at the Tweetcaster logo screen when opening (more regularly) and now the app crashes when I try to pull to refresh. Also tapping the column tile no longer jumps to the top of the feed. Used to be great
"Latest update has ruined it. Difficulty refreshing
Its a good app byt evrytime I opened it starts at the last tweet posted not at the last tweetd I viewed.  Its annoying cause I missed all the previous tweets that I didnt see. Please fix that
"Only complaint is that the widget does not display picture preview in tweets
Overall well done app. Use it all the time. Has some great features the Twitter app does not.
"These Updates Have Been The Worst
Cool app much better than the twitter app itself.
I've used them all
Always scrolls to the top straight away now. Can't find the last tweet you read.  Makes it absolutely useless
"Simple design
what happened to remembering the position?
Would be five star but feed position is not remembered with latest update
Hands down this is the best twitter app
After updating it doesn't remember my feed position anymore.
"This was one of the best tweeter apps out there.   I have a Samsung Galaxy Note 3
"Since the update
"doesn't refresh
"The best Twitter client out there
"Used to be okay

No comparison
"Can't see who favorites tweets without browser. Since update
Latest update is a total bugfest on my Nexus7 2013. Clicking on user name now opens profile which totally screws app. Gone from best app to unusable. Please fix this.
Why away automatic close?
"Have used a number of other apps
Love It
"Like the ""zip"" feature. Like that it can sync position with iOS version. Does streaming. Very reliable. Only wish is that it would inline images from Flickr."
Great app
Nice just wish I could copy/paste text.
Outstanding App! I use it on all my devices.
"Your money on this app. Just get the free app. I originally gave this app give starts
Best twitter so app
The best Twitter app.
It's my favorite app. Second to none.  Smart filter is such a key feature
Good
"Has gotten really
The only Twitter client I want to use
"I tried using this for a couple of days
used to be a perfect app. Now it's worthless..
Does everything you want a twitter app to do.
Favorite twitter app for Android
"The most recent updates have been awful. App hangs tweeting pics
Eye catching design on screen. Always connect even if the network signal is poor.
No problems for me on this app. I used the free one loads so decided to buy it.
"This is really a good application
App still doesn't notify me of DMs or mentions properly. I will be lucky to get one through every few months.
"Have tried other Twitter apps but came back to this one and have purchased the pro edition
Does everything I want quickly and easily.
Super slow frequent errors crash after crash
Much better than the twitter app for android that just doesn't work
I've tried all the others and this is the best.
Great
Love this so much better than the original version of twitter!! More tweet options and personalization options!👍
"In terms of features
Really great
Great app 😎
This app used to be so great. The more people I follow the more the feed lags or freezes. It often stops responding and has to be closed.
Reminds me of sliced bread
It won't signinto twitter even tho my details are correct!
In my opinion this is the best app for tweeter. Cool design and powerfull tool for tweet-time
It just forcloses alot
"I have 'custom notifications' turned on
nice and very good
Good
Great app Needs to update regularly.
The only way to tweet
"It takes too long for things to load. For example
Use on both my Android devices - looks great and performs great.
Interactions yes!!!!  please!!!!!
"Tried many when I was looking for a good app
Would work perfect if it didn't freeze when its updating new tweets. It also freezes when trying to send a new tweet.
"Great app
Best app for twitter love it
By far the best twitter app out there.
I love it
Its good but it needs an update I dnt get notifications on mentions I sometimes get em on new tweets but its real sporadic it works when it wants sluggish theres a delay in composing new tweets & in them posting
"Nothing but ""protocol error 404"" these past few weeks.  Useless app.  Downloading other app.  Galaxy Note 2"
Dopo l'adattamento a ICS il miglior client twitter per Android. Per ora almeno...
"Nothing like staring at the bird for 30 seconds while nothing happens. If i don't get that I'll get the  ""This app isn't responding message"" every third or fourth time I try to use the app. Often closes for absolutely no reason.  More often than not its simply unresponsive until I finally give up.   Shall I go on???"
Love it
"Crashes during every single action.  Crashed during composition
"What happened to the tweetcaster pro widget it disappeared on my galaxy note 2
Does exactly what it says on the tin
Superb! Thank you.
"Good app. Love the scheduled tweets. Also lists. Haven't found another good twitter app that does it well. Wish the interface followed Google's Holo design guidelines. Docked a star for that. Otherwise
Much better than any other app. Doesn't use much memory and doesn't slow phone down
Bought 4 twitter clients.  This is the best among those for tablet.
ve the app...does everything I need it to
Recommend it
Why is there double comments sent to FB when linked?
Best Twitter client ever.
The best.
Every useful inconvenient app
Nice app
Great so far
My fave twitter client!!  Maurice Washington
UI could be better
I have used it for several years and never have had problems.  I just never got around to rating it.
"Great app much better than Twitter app.  UPDATE: Don't like the popup ads on the paid version
Take a bit of time to get used to the interface and this twitter app isn't half bad. Still a little messy and sluggish at times but there aren't many better than this for tablets in my opinion.
sometimes stopped and not speed enough when open
This has been the best program I've ever used for Twitter. Tech support is quick and helpful.
"Tweetcaster is awesome
This is the BEST Twitter client ever!
Best ever
"My favorite Twitter app for Android.  Fun UI
Just the best tweeter client as far so do not hesitate to buy
Update issues
Awesome
"I'm on Twitter all the time and am always looking for the most efficient
Great app.
I like it…
My favorite social application. An excellent adjunct to Twitter itself. Highly recommended.
Great app I love it : )
I really like the official Twitter app but it takes more resources than I like. Tweetcaster is probably the best Twitter app with lower resource requirements.
Love it Love the app but lets try a new look
Much preferred to the official twitter app.
Nothing comes close. The brwy
Excellent. I love it.
Extremely slow
App keeps getting hung up when composing new tweet.  Updates timeline perfectly.   Used to love this app
My favorite app for twitter but it seems to be getting slower by the day. If I click to read a link or see a pix it takes over 30 seconds to go there and 30 seconds to come back.
Nice
Since weeks ago the app runs very very very slow. Yesterday I installed JellyBean 4.3 and today the app was so slow than ever before.
"Great app
It's excellent.
I just love this application.
Love it!
"It's one of the best
I'm no longer able to see thumbnails or avatars..
After trying more paid Twitter clients than I should have; I decided I like this one best.
Sometimes it stops for no reason.
"Love the latest functionality improvements
I got a problem loading the profile of an active user I followed after she reactivated her account.
Love this app!
Zip it is the greatest
Best twitter client period
Love it! Especially like the interactions feature.
Best app for Twitter!
I love love love this app. Had to buy the Pro version.
I took 2 stars away ncause this app is very slow and takes forever to open and for you to send a tweet....fix the issue and I'll give the stars back.
Above par Twitter app. Far superior to Peep included on the HTC Incredible.
I love this app and fixed old issues but now it is extremely slow to open and tweet it takes thirty secs to open I had to download another app I might have to unistall
The best twitter app I've used.
Thank you
Great app!
Works great and have good themes.   Has the future of sending long tweet through tweetlonger or multiple tweet s.  Has unique feature of scheduling tweets.
"I never miss a Tweet with it. Even after 24 hours
Better than official app!
The app Works great!  R.I.P Nelson Mandela
"Ok
Great app for tweeters. Only drawback? No backup option in case you wipe your phone
"The best twitter app! However

"What can I say 
LOVE IT
works flawlessly
Nice!
This format is much easier to work with. It's made using Tweeter fun again. I also enjoy changing the colors. Thank you Tweeter.  I have a Samsung Galaxy S4 and so far there have no issues.
Easy to use.
Works great on all my devices.
Stable and fast. Beautiful UI
Since upgrading to Nexus 5 this app no longer works. Just shows splash screen. Never gets any further than this.
Better than any other Twitter app
Best twitter app  for android period!!
It's a feature packed twitter app that works well for the most part. A few things such as not seeing who RT what or favorites your posts is a Minor annoyance but what really grinds my gears is how slow it is and laggy at times. When you want to post it takes a good 5 seconds before the compose pops up sometimes the screen stays stuck on the splash screen or just lags out when sending. A shame because it definitely is a very good app but these shortcomings make me just want to use the official twitter app
Way better than Twitter app. It's a lot smaller too. My favorite and worth every penny!
Blows away the rest by far...full featured and great looking. Twitter's own offering is the poor cousin in comparison!
"Love it
Excellent tweeter
Good overall
Like the design and the themes. But most I like the Readability integration. On a smartphone that is bloody brilliant!
l Like It
"It seems that every other update breaks the app. The scrolling on the phone version stops working properly. When I launch the app
Great...nice...and thanks!
crashes on my nexus 7 when I try to reply or retweet
Works perfect and the features are dope ! Cool ape .
Every time I send a DM or switch profiles it crashes.
"Using this because Twitter's own app is a hot mess. But this isn't that much better. You can't see who starred you
TwitterCaster is better than Twitter. Like it!!
Live search little slow but good app overall. Always switching between this and Plume. Would be nice if it's more accurate on nearby tweets.
"This is one app that I'm sorry I paid for. Constant hangs
Love it
But far this is the best Twitter app.
The auto update only works when it feels like it. There are times when I won't get an update alert for a day or 2 and then it updates I have no choice but to skip a ton of tweets just to get current. Makes it hard to justify keeping this app installed.
can you make more themes ? its so dull..
It is cool app but sometimes crashed suddenly.
Super functionality
Very good app.
"Constantly telling me when i go in the no host and something bout no api address... also
Great app!!
"I have tried a few apps for Twitter
Better than all the rest -  having tried everything else there's nothing to compare with  it.
Great app. Excellent UI
Works well on the note 2. A heavy app but great search function makes it really useful
Nothing compares to you!!!
Great! Cool app
"Not many Twitter apps left
Buying the pro version is a no-brainer. Do it!
See above
Best yet
Used to be my favorite because of the features but it's so ugly..
If it was not for this app I would not be in tune with Twitter I would be so lost
My favorite Twitter app. Lots of features that regular Twitter doesn't have.
Works perfect
My favorite
Continued efforts to better it all the time... I've tried others but have given up. I always come back to this app!
Best Twitter app period.
Works great  no problems
Best Twitter app I've found.

The latest updates bog down my Galaxy S3.
Sweet
Much better than stock or any other Twitter app I've come across
Love love  this app...easy to use.
Coming from a long time Tweetbot experience in iOS this one is best for me.
Great app with a nice price for ad removal.
I like the layout of the tablet version over the phone version.
Fav Twitter app use it all the time
After my switch from iOS to Android I needed something to replace tweetbot and this fit the bill perfectly
Love everything about it.
Woah! Everything you can think of when it comes to simplifying and organizing all of those tweets! So easy to group things and I love the menu options which allow you to move through the web of followers/following people.  Great up!
Simply awesome
"This app has been around for several years
This twitter client is by far the easiest and best!!!!  Great job
Like the nearby status!
It works better than the original Twitter app because you can post to Facebook at the same time. It also has a web browser built in to make it easy to view links.
Seriously?  I pay for an ad-free pro version and you still show ads when switching between Twitter accounts. Get rid of this and I give you 5 stars again.
Awesome app again after update
"Can somebody help me
"Won't stream tweets. Horrible lag. Try to refresh the tweets
"Powerful! Really powerful! You can edit lists
Completely amazing

It's not chick feed?
Hands down. This APP does it all in twitterland. Worth buying.
Fantastic Twitter app. Must have app (all problems with 4.1 are fixed in 4.2). 100% worth the money. Could be the best Twitter client for
Thank you for fixing timeline issues!  Samsung Galaxy S3 - CleanRom 7
This new update today screwed up something. Every time I launch an app I get notification that you have reached your limit for this action. Try after blah blah time. Ps fix this!
One of the best twitter apps
"How
Tweetcaster Pro has become my primary Twitter interface.  The features and ease of use has made me a more active tweeter.  Great work!
Works as described on the tin.
I bought the Pro version as I loved the free one but didn't like the banner ads. As of recently the Pro version occasionally starts to show ads when in portrait mode on my Nexus 10 tablet. Please fix! After the fix I can increase my rating again.
Simply the best. None of its competitors gets even close.
I love this app so much. It's user friendly.  No hassle.
Used to be my favorite Twitter app but no longer tells me who retweeted or favorited my tweets. And to think I paid for a lesser quality app....
"Ok since the last update when it refreshes it jumps straight to the top of the screen
Excellent
"The readability sometimes messes up
Therevis some issue with softwer it is closed some time when i try to moveing up or down
"Years ago this was my faaavooritte app
"Best app for Twitter
"Since I updated
Great ap
Its really amazing..I like it.
Setting a schedule for Tweets needs added!
Not good right now fix issues
I have a couple strange things  happening on my phone.  Better than the twitter app.
With the new update its locking up my timeline.
Comment/reply box takes ages to appear. Now timeline very slow about 59mins behind...  Older versions much better!
I've tried lots of Twitter clients but this one combines tons of powerful tools with an uncluttered design and support for phones and tablets. Not as pretty as newer competitors like Carbon or falcon pro but way more usable.
Just great work here
Improved!
I use to use it constantly!  It freezes very much and its slow! Please fix! Galaxy note 2
I enjoy using this more then Twitter or Tweetcaster.
Perfect
"The new interface is ugly. You tried to make it looks cool and fancy but you failed
Should I go on?

I've been on twitter for 4 years now and tweetcaster has been the best twitter app. Never let me down.

I hate watching a youtybe video through this. Make it so I can turn that option off. I can't rate or read comments while watching
"This recent upgrade was the last straw
Baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaad
Wish it wouldn't lag as much
The app crashed too many times in 5 seconds!!!
"Plz
"I definitely will use
Best twitter app!
"I paid for this and every time it starts it shows ads at the bottom of the screen
"Great job for fixing the problems we highlighted
"The app is not designed to work well on tablets. There is no clear way to find out whether a tap on the tweet will invoke the list of replies to that tweet or it will invoke the menu. More often
I would like to see a option for color tweet box like your tweets and replies that you can set that coincides with people you follow that also follow you. So that way you can follow your friends better instead of setting everyone with the little color bar on the side.
using galaxy s4
Please add retweets to mention list and notification
"Crashed when i'm scroll faster up2down using my best theme "" classic dark """
All that's missing from this app is an auto expand feature for shortened tweets
"Haven't seen a full screen ad in a while
Awesome
Love tweetcaster
Its work great majority of the time. Its just been a few times where it didn't want to refresh my timeline
Best twitter app in the play store.

"I loved Tweetcaster so much
Nice n smooth.
Best I've seem out there so far
Nothing much 2 say except I like!!!
"I used to love this app now it sucks! Super slow and forces closed before and/or after every action. Won't refresh tweets either. I'm deleting tweetcaster
Great app. Love everything about it.
Receive Notifications with out refresh. Which kills battery
"Good all around usage
Great app
Tek kelimeyle harika.arayüz değişikliği olsa daha iyi olacak.
Would get a 5 but won't support smileys on note 3.android pro widgets does as does ubersocial. There's always a flaw with these apps.frustrating
Beats the original app hands down!
"I have tried many 3rd party apps for Twitter and I feel most at home with Tweetcaster. And oh
"I would definitely prefer a cleaner UI design
Awful tweetmarker support.   Randomly scrolls.   Clumsy UI.   Use the regular twitter client rather than paying for this junk.  Oh and they don't respond to support requests.
"Alot of options
"The notifications on the Samsung S4 never come through to my phone. If a user deletes a tweet it still shows it as posted
Works well on my droid fone.
I paid for it thinking the app will improve but it still says not responding everyday that I open it
"Except I can't add new followers from email
Really nice app .
Bang tidy!
I'd like if it showed on others profiles if they followed me.
It's great.  Download it

No problems at all
Using nexus 7 and am getting this error...unable to load tweetcaster pro.  Who can help?
I love tweetcaster its the best twitter app around.
Love the look and ease of use. It's just pipped Plume as my Twitter app of choice at the moment. Easier to find options ... and quicker to sign out when I don't want a drain on my battery or data usage.
Great app
Every time they update this application there is a problem with uploading attachments.
Superb!
"Ease of use
This is definitely my Go-To twitter app. Love the fluidity and features.
The gd app is Rude! Uninstalling.

Just comply to the way Google wants their apps to be. You can still keep all functionality. If Apple told you to you would do it smh
Since latest update I cannot tweet or retweet on my S4!!

Need to imrove UI
The easiest for Twitter.
Excellent... 🙌
They ruined a great app. Don't update. When viewing images in the gallery the app freezes. The swipe feature is a good idea but causes my GS4 to lock up. Fix this please.....
Please add a theme that isn't so cartoonish. Everything else is just perfect.
Much better than the Official Twitter app
Can't say enough amazing things about this app! Been using the pro version on my tablet & phone for years now! Hook me up One Louder with an iOS pro code! just got an iPod! :)

Only thing would make it better is more beautiful themes or skins. Even widget is lovely.  Also I'm seeing my posts as a double currently. Not a big deal but I did think I was double posting so deleted and lost entire tweet.
"Overall really good
In terms of functionality it's great but I still get ads and this is not acceptable. Uninstalled.
It just needs larger image preview too small it's an inconvenience to open every picture just to see it..  JLB

worth paying the extra few pounds for to get rid of the ads you get on the free version. no problems whatsoever :) easy to use and I would choose this over the twitter app for android any day.
Excellent app for tweeting and loaded with options wish it were lighter tho
Nothing is different from the free app...stole our money having us think it was better and different.what a joke
Recommended suprising how better this is than anything else. Get it!
Completely unnecessary spam especially in a paid app.
Double posts in TL since last update.
Will no longer open since last update.  S4. When it works its great. 5 stars when it actually opens
"I like the look & feel of this app & I would rank 5 star IF all of my posts didn't display twice (they don't actually post twice but they do display twice on my feed) & if I could see a person's pics (not the ones in the feed

"I use to LOVE this app and recommend it to everyone I possibly could. Somewhere within the last couple of updates it's became real unstable. Force closes all the time and doesn't tweet ny scheduled tweets anymore. Use to be my favorite twitter app
There is a problem when i open the app its closed
Please quit updating!
Better than Twitter's app.
"Paid version
Love tweetcaster. Especially now that I don't have to worry about ads. Haven't had any problems thus far.
Why is it this paid version is worse than free ones? Only no ads? This sucks
Love tweetcaster!!! Just need the Zip it function to work again
I ♡ TweetCaster Pro best twitter app on tha Android market (Galaxy S4)
Only twitter app I use. I love it. So easy and live the Zip feature.
Nothing more to add really.
I have used em all and its the best hands down.
MUCH BETTER than the standard Twitter client
Nice fun app
Crashes alot
It's a pretty gd app but it keep doubling my tweets. Smh
"Double posts in timeline 
Great twitter Client
"Very good. A few annoying flaws: (1) posts appear double in gS3
Meets my needs and then some. Simple to use and thats a plus for me. Recommended!
Great Twitter client. Would be perfect if it had a full screen widget. Hope dev adds one.
Tweetcaster is very buggy on my S3!
Its good but it needs some improvement
The only reason I would give this app is because I don't get notifications when someone retweet or follow me. Add this features please
Use to love the app but now it keeps crashing and force closing.
"Highly recommend it. Only negative is I still get twitter time outs on the paid version
It is nice
The internal interface for internet usage on this app absolutely sucks. It has stopped working completely i'd rather it re-route me to my stock browser like it used to as opposed to this faux internet setup the app uses... almost time to get a diff twitter app. Sadly i paid for this one Samsung Galaxy 3
Easy and Good
"If love twitter
"This was really good initially
Well worth going pro.
I find Tweetcaster really good for daily use. It's easy to navigate functionality is easy-to-use and poses very little in the way of problems.
Notifications just don't work!
Some lag here and there and once in a while it likes to scroll back down to older posts. All in all a solid app I would choose over others.
Locks up my phone.
It was a good enough app for me to go from free version to Pro.
Outstanding app except for the ads and the price to remove them seemed reasonable to me
Does it all and does it well!
"If you're going to charge for an app
My posts show as double and I can't use the take a picture function for attachments without it causing the app to close itself out.
I love it
Notifications are coming slow and post are showing up twice! Please fix
Great
"After enjoying this app for some time now it has recently became very buggy. Notifications don't work on HTC One
Always works well and simple to use! :)
it's not working ..always crash  Htc one
I'm getting double tweets when I post.  But I do love the Retweet with comment.
Good app!
"everything is ok
Lots of great features
I like the fact I can keep my business and personal twitter on the same app
Why it appears double in my timeline when I tweet? And the notifications are way too slow. Fix this please
Purchased pro version coz I need to use this without advertisements. Best app ever for tweeting. Still I love it. Coz of its simplicity
Very good
Love this twitter app! Nothing beats it
Loved it before I had to log onto facebook to post a photo. Keep them seperate. Looking elsewhere now...
Thus app is way better than the original twitter.  I have tried almost every twitter app there is but I keep returning.
Woth the 5 bucks to upgrade.. best twitter client out there
Totally brilliant app! Much nicer to use than any other I've tried and packed with great features. 6 out of 5
Customization is great and easy and fun to use.
The most important option in this App is Interaction option but it doesn't existing now.  Please fix it and return it back. Thx
"When I tweet with mix of arabic words
Love it
"Running sooooooo better
Good
Always come back to this app. Left for carbon for a bit but so much better this app. Left cause got tired of same thing. More themes id give 5 stars!
Putrid on tablets.
"zip it
"I've waited for a long time assuming that eventually an update will fix the problem. No improvement at all
The most peaceful app  Great
It has really taken me too long to figure things out. I eish they had better notifications.
"I'm having to clear cache and force stop so much these days because of searches not loading
"Dont like it
Make picture change able too use whole picture instead of cropping it & more theme options
Like the new colors and the new setup and I now have more options.
*Start up App.. still slow *Need Tweet press and tweets like official Twitter App * Bubbles Theme bubble colour must be changeable
Best twitter app I've ever use.
"Best twitter app
The FaceBook add on is glitchy though.
But how do you tell who is following you?
Have found this app to be ahead of its rivals in functionality and ease of use.
Love this app!!!!!!!
Don't know why I waited so long with inferior Twitter clients and ads. This is well worth the 3 quid.
Very stable and easy to learn. I like it and recommend it
I LOVE .
The best app for twitter..nice layout
Love it
Poor app
It wonderful program Easy to use I advise every one to use it
Best twitter app
احلي شي
"pleas try to fix it 
Has so many helpful things to make Twitter work great
"After the update to my mobile to 4.2.2
"A easy to use
"Functional
No complaints!
One of the apps that suits my needs.
It is a very good and nice application for Twitter! It helped me a lot.
One of the best app in the market.. But after the last update copying tweet are not working fine but still the best for tweeters.And the app is freeze all the time plz.  fix it.
Fast and smooth
Works nice app recommended
This app is amazing. (:
I bught the pro its the best  prigram I use it for my galaxy for iohone I use tweetbot the best.
Excellent
This app WAS my favorite. Now it crashes and lags HORRIBLY everytime I open it. Its unusable. What happened? Samsung g3
Beautifuly designed but you can't use it for more than 5 minutes without crashing
"There are a lot of twitter apps out there
Better than twitter
Can't use it at all with CyanogenMod 10.1 on galaxy S3. Constant forced close. Tried every thing clear cache and data. Uninstall and reinstall. Sad I liked it but have to look for alternative.
vgood
"Love the app
Keep it this way
Does everything I need it to with no fuss. Good customisation options too.
The most comprehensive twitter client I've ever used.
I got the paid version with No advertisement
"Why you guys cancelled the refresh all button? This button was a good tool to clean those ""cached deleted tweets"" from my timeline"
Upgraded to PRO and haven't looked back! Fast! Efficient! Just a great app
Its good
It's my go to app.
شغال تمام مع اس فور اروع برنامج مر علي لتويتر
Fix it. Now.
"Awesome app
"Absolutely top of the list. Tweetcaster
freezing & force close :(
"Go Pro
I have tried several Twitter clients on my Galaxy S 3 and this is the best.
Easy to use
Excellent
Only app for Twitter I will use. The best!!
It is the only Twitter client I would use.  Fantastic!
"Since last update
For months my app has been crashing. I've done everything to try & fix issue. I hate I can't give a negative rating. I can't believe I paid for this crappy app. Free version was perfect upgraded to pro and now I wish I hadn't. Don't waste your money!
من أفضل برامج تويتر في الأندرويد
Great
"I like zipping and especially the overlay of account images for retweets. The free version's ads however were quite annoying
Glad the bugs are fixed
After trying several Twitter apps. this is the one for me.
"Slow and unresponsive. Constant force close and black screens and freezes. Had to turn off live streaming so it would not freeze up as much. Transitions usually take 5 secs or so. As much as this app costs
"Why doesn't tablet pro version (Note 8) have multiple display options like mobile pro version? Other than that
Love it!!! Best app I've tried so far. I've been very happy with the pro version.
Lame.
I started with app left to try others then came back and it is clearly the best one.
Thumbs up
I would like to be able to retweet with a comment on any tweet. Other apps allow but I do love this application
Way better than Twitter!!!  Gracias
Top twitter app IMO. Great options and customizations.
Well done for restoring the Interactions facility
No complaints.
"Can't see who favorites my tweets
Best by far
5 stars for bringing back the interaction option.
This is probably the best twitter app on Android been using a while and have found nothing else even close to being as good.  There is one bug on the app currently it show's my own tweets twice at times.
Love it!!
"Sometimes it freezes
"Quite expensive for a twitter client
"Most reliable
It's a quite good app. The read marker is still a little wacky though.
Best Twitter app!
Responsive developers a bonus.
Now that interaction are back. I expect more improvement .. such as reduce of lag and stability.   Overall 5 stars.
Everytime a new feature gets added the app gets slower and lags
After that increadible update ... it is perfect now and worth to earn 5 stars :)
The best Twitter  app that i have found.
"Best twitter app out there. Whatever you want of features
So you're back to 5 stars. My only Twitter client.
Just about the best client available
This app need more customization period great app but this is droid i should be able to change everything
A few kinks but overall a great app. Slow at times but could be my phone.
When can we buffer retweets directly? I want that feature really really bad! :-) Awesome job!
"After Falcon Pro locked me out due to the incompetent developer resetting the API keys constantly and blocking people who paid for his app
"The constant force close
"Easy to use.  Nice additions
Enjoyed the free version so much I had to purchase it. Galaxy S IV
"I have previously rated the free version
Best twitter app.
How can u give a bad rating if they had no choice in taking off the interactions feature. It isn't there fault and shouldnt get a bad review or rating because of it.
Keeps crashing all the time on my Galaxy S4!!
I liked the free version and just upgraded to pro. Definitely worth the five bucks. No ads and a dark back drop. Perfect for me. I love the zip feature so I don't have to see spoilers for my favorite books or shows. Readability makes viewing links easier when I have time. Definitely superior to the Twitter app.
"Nexus7 Hardly ever opens
Easy-to-use
The person who decided to get rid of the interaction tab should be fired! Why would you get rid of the interaction tab on a social networking site ... where people interact : /
Upgrading does nothing. I LITERALLY GAVE THEM MONEY FOR ADVERTISING TO ME.
"It refuses to become obsolete... This veteran
The best. Thank you.
Very good twetter app but crashes too much and the tablet version doesnt open on my galaxy tab 10.1	Not very good
Great!
Can you please give us who payed for the app the option to turn off the startup screen. I don't want to have to see the startup screen every time I open the app.
"Great app for those who love to tweet. However with the recent departure of the 'interactions' button you can't easily see who's followed
Hand Down the best twitter app I ever used.
My fave app
Bring it back asap please.
I use this every day brilliant app..A++++
Been using the Pro version for a while now and love it. Zip option is awesome. Took a couple of hrs to work out but now im a pro. LOVE THE APP!
"I like how TweetCaster embeds image previews in each tweet
Excellent
Twitter client of choice without doubt. Excellent.
Tried pretty much every Twitter app out there. Always come back to Tweetcaster.
If ever you wanted to pay for good software just to support good software this is it.  Best twitter client ever.
Where the hell did the interaction bar go?!?!?!?! Stupid!!!!!!!!
"Sure enough this is a good app
Even better than the previous tweetcaster. The best twitter app out there!
I like it. Easy to use and pretty much has everything you need.  I find the notifications a little slow to come through at times.
"Ever since the update its a piece of crap
Love it
"I paid for the interaction feature
Dont know why its crashing all the time on my HTC One.
It's ok
Taking the interactions option makes me want to find a new app. Please bring it back. Please.
It seems to do everything I want.
"Other than rare glitches
"Interactions are not allowed in any Twitter apps now due to Twitter changing the API. This is not the fault of the dev. It is twitter trying to migrate people back to their own app (which is the only app now allowed the interactions). Just check Tweetings and Falcon
I've been using Tweetcaster for over a year and I still love using it!
Works better than my old phone use to black out
Gone now? Really? Uninstalled
Great app!
"App used to have 5 stars until my interactions failed to load and it stopped letting me tweet pictures. No idea as to what happened
Any link I click tries to get to the the browser but crashes back to Tweetcaster.
"After being able to use it
No other can compare!
I only bought this app because it was the only decent app where you could also see interactions and now you can't. Safe to say I'm uninstalling.
Can't load pics and interactions doesn't work
You've seriously got to fix this issue.
Was the best by far but now intermittently not being allowed to post photos. Getting the API 1.0 message. Is this being sorted?
I cant post photos.. it keeps telling me to move to twitter v1.1 when will you provide an update for this. Everything else is perfect.
"I'd kick the back door and sling one right up this apps marmite motorway. I would give this app 5 stars if it didn't keep asking me to rate it.  EDIT:  June 2013 update stops me posting pictures intermittently
"i love this update
App was great until the last update. Now I get an API message when trying to tweet a picture. Very frustrating.
crashes on s4 please fix it
There Я so many suprises on it!!
Better than twitter app
"...this new update completely made my ""interactions"" section pointless. It fails to load every time. I've restarted
Feel the power. This app rocks!
"Besides the fact that OneLouder does not respond/fix bugs
Bugs New bugs. No url shortening. Now having cleared data won't reload accounts
dear..suddenly the app is closed my mobile is samsung S 4 also I have other app for twitter also the same problem4 I cant load more tweets...very poor app for samsung s4 I ask the support team many time but no result..now the 2nd upadet but the problem still
A great twitter app. It has just gotten better over time.
The Best twitter app ever...
So it ends up that it was my phones fault and not one louder...faith restored
Not working
Latest version taking forever to download. Cleared cache. What the hell?
It's a great app. I like it but not seeing if you got any new followers in the notifications sucks. Fix that and I'll give 5 stars
Great app! I love it.
It's amazing and easy to use just needs more themes.
Thanks for the dedicated updates and fixes etc. Awesome
